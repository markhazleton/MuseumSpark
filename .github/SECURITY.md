## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this project for planning personal travel. It is a static site (Phase 1) and will eventually be a self-hosted API (Phase 2).

If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., XSS in the browse page, or a data injection issue), please do NOT open an issue.

Instead, please email **<mark.hazleton@gmail.com>** (or the repository owner's public email).

We will work to resolve the issue promptly.
