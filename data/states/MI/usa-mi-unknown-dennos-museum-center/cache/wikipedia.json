  "extract": "The Dennos Museum Center is a fine art museum and cultural center located in Traverse City, Michigan on the campus of Northwestern Michigan College (NMC). Most notable for its permanent collection of Inuit art, the Dennos Museum opened in 1991 and features rotating exhibitions of Modern and Contemporary art. The museum consists of three changing exhibit galleries, a sculpture court, an Interactive Discovery Gallery for children and adults, and semi-permanent galleries for Inuit art and the museum's permanent collections. The museum has a permanent collection of 3,100 works, of which nearly 2,000 are Inuit art prints and sculptures. The museum is home to three temporary exhibition galleries that cover 8,000 square feet (740 m2) combined with an additional 12,000 square feet of semi-permanent exhibition space for the museum's permanent collection. As a cultural center, the Dennos Museum Center also provides exhibitions and programs in the sciences and performing arts. It includes the Milliken Auditorium, a 367-seat concert hall that hosts an annual concert series emphasizing world, jazz and blues music along with NMC and community events. The museum also oversees a collection of 14 outdoor sculptures by international and Michigan artists on the grounds of the college campus. In 2000, the museum was recognized by ArtServe Michigan with the Governor's Award for Arts and Culture.",
