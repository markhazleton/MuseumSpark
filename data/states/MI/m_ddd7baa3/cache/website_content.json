Over that time, the organization called a number of locations home, drew leadership from a long list of Executive Directors, and has been guided by an extensive list of community members serving on its Board of Directors. The organization has successfully endured fire, floods, and even a global pandemic, and through it all, continues to chart a course forward.\n\nThe Heritage is turning the page to write the next chapter in its long history. This new chapter will see The Heritage transform into a much leaner version of itself, better aligned to optimally serve the community. To this end, the organization is moving out of its home for the past 27 years and has moved a couple of smaller exhibits into a temporary space on Ship Street. This location will be open on weekends between Memorial Day and Labor Day and on other special occasions. The archives will temporarily be moved to Memorial Hall.\n\nThe Board of Directors is enthusiastic about the new opportunities to collaborate with you – our supporters – and the wider communities. We are dedicated to inspiring and promoting the history of St. Joseph, Benton Harbor, and the surrounding areas with innovative engagement and interaction.\n\n* * *\n\n### Lighthouse Tours now hosted by St. Joe Toda...",
