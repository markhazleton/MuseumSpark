The Arb is located adjacent to the Huron River, and features over 400 species, including 110 species of trees, in a varied, hilly landscape. A signature feature of Nichols Arboretum is the W. E. Upjohn Peony Garden, which features the largest collection of heirloom peonies in North America. Nichols Arboretum was designed by noted American landscape gardener and University of Michigan alumnus O. C. Simonds, and opened in 1907. The 128-acre (52 ha) arboretum is named for Esther Connor Nichols and her husband Walter, who donated part of the land for the arboretum in 1906.",
