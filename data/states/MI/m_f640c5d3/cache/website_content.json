  "accessibility_text": "# **Join Us in Celebrating Diversity**\n\nThe Holland Museum has a unique platform to engage other non-profits, social service organizations, schools, and universities in partnerships that bring awareness and meaningful conversations to the community. In alignment with our institutional value of _Inclusion_ : _We Welcome Everyone and Their Stories_ , the Holland Museum continues to grow our community partnerships, exhibitions, and programs that celebrate, recognize, and honor Holland’s diversity.\n\nBeginning with [_THEM: Images of Separation_](https://hollandmuseum.org/exhibition/them-images-of-separation/)(2019) and then [_United for Progress: The Story of LAUP_](https://hollandmuseum.org/exhibition/united-for-progress-the-laup-story/) (2021), [_Contemporary Portraits of Native Americans_](https://hollandmuseum.org/exhibition/contemporary-portraits-of-native-americans-by-james-cook/) (2022) and [_Black Eden: Idlewild Past, Present, and Future_](https://hollandmuseum.org/exhibition/black-eden-idlewild-past-present-and-future/) (2023), the Holland Museum is committed to developing and hosting thought-provoking, visually stimulating exhibitions that explore culturally relevant historical and contemporary topics. **Cultural Lens** is an ongoing series of talks, performances, family programs, and panel discussions that further support the museum’s DEI mission. \n\nLearn more about [current exhibitions](https://hollandmuseum.org/visit-us/exhibitions-list-2/), [past exhibitions](https:/...",
