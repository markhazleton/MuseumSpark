  "extract": "The University of Michigan–Flint (UM-Flint) is a public university in Flint, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1956 as the Flint Senior College, it was initially established as a remote branch of the University of Michigan, offering upper-division undergraduate courses. The institution developed into a fully-fledged university and received accreditation in 1970. Subsequently, the name was changed to the University of Michigan–Flint. It continues to adhere to the policies of the University of Michigan Board of Regents without having a separate governing board. UM-Flint is one of the five doctoral/professional universities in the state of Michigan. Together with Oakland University, the University of Michigan–Dearborn, and Wayne State University, UM-Flint is one of the four Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities (CUMU) members in the State of Michigan. The university's student-athletes compete in intramural and club sports as the Michigan-Flint Wolverines. Notable alumni include former Best Buy executive Shari Ballard, former United States Senator Donald Riegle, and Oscar-winning film director Michael Moore, who was an editor for the student newspaper The Michigan Times.",
