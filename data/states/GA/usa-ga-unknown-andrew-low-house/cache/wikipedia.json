They are the birthplace of Juliette Gordon Low, at 10 East Oglethorpe Avenue, the Andrew Low House, at 329 Abercorn Street, and the Andrew Low Carriage House (also known as the First Girl Scout Headquarters), at 330 Drayton Street. The birthplace and headquarters was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. The Andrew Low house, where Juliette lived with her husband, was a later addition to the National Register application, creating the Juliette Gordon Low Landmark District in 1966. These properties are also located within the Savannah Historic District.",
