Georgia Representative Thomas E. Watson was instrumental in proposing this legislation, which became a fully functioning service around 1905. Prior to RFD, the post offices in the 1800s were often located in general stores or the living rooms of prominent citizens. Early post offices became gathering spots for the community, where folks socialized and exchanged information about area events.\n\n‍  \n\n‍Local historians Ed Malowney, Connie Mashburn, and Barbara Latham have researched these early post offices in what is now the City of Milton. They will discuss how these institutions arose and the early settlers who served as postmasters. Familiar names of some of the old Milton post offices: Crabapple, Webb, Freemansville, Troy/Arnold, Fields Cross Roads, Birmingham, Social Hill, and Devore.\n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\n‍  \n\nAbout our preemminent speakers...\n\nEd Malowney is the president of the Alpharetta and Old Milton County Historical Society.
