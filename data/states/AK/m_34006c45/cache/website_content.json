We are the heart of Kodiak. We are about our community and its history. This place is for anyone who lives in or loves this place.\n\nIn 2019, the Kodiak Historical Society completed a $750,000 Permanent Exhibits Redesign and Facility Upgrade Project with generous support from the City of Kodiak, Murdock Charitable Trust, Rasmuson Foundation and the community of Kodiak. The redesigned community center feature collaborative, community driven, approachable permanent exhibits that showcase Kodiak’s history.\n\n_Kodiak Historical Society, P-335-1_\n\n### Kodiak History Museum on Instagram\n\n[ Join us for a special exhibit opening Friday, Janu ](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTWUuYXgY2P/)\n\n[ The Kodiak History Museum is closed TODAY (1/9/26) ](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTTbkjCgf5C/)\n\n[ 🍽️ Foodie Fridays! 🍲The Kodiak History Museum has  ](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTBBJshCTNU/)\n\n[ Happy New Year from the Kodiak History Museum! 🎉 A ](https://www.instagram.com/p/DS9Qz7ak9z...",
