Please be aware if you add the John Paul Jones House on a 230pm tour you must see it first. It was closed after our tour but the society staff refunded us. And we enjoyed visiting with them at the lovely gift shop. Next visit we will see all the old homes that were pointed out on the tour and go to Strawberry Banke. Portsmouth is a delightful city and everyone we met was so friendly and helpful we will definitely be returning soon.",

      "content_description": "**Currier Museum of Art** in Manchester punches above its regional profile, offering a concentrated, high-quality encounter with European and American art in galleries designed for unhurried viewing. Expect a satisfying sweep from Old Master painting to modern and contemporary works, with particular strength in American art and the kinds of pieces that reward repeat visits—paintings, prints, photographs, and decorative arts presented in a clear, visitor-friendly layout. For art enthusiasts, the pleasure here is the museum’s *curatorial focus*: you can move from luminous European canvases to distinctly American voices and then to modern innovations without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nJust as memorable is the museum’s architectural dimension. The main building delivers a clean, welcoming setting that keeps the emphasis on the art, but the true pilgrimage for design lovers is the museum’s stewardship of two Frank Lloyd Wright homes, the Zimmerman House (1950) and the Kalil House (1955). These guided tours—often requiring advance booking—offer a rare chance to experience Wright’s *Usonian* ideals in situ: built-in furniture, rhythmic geometries, and carefully framed views that make everyday space feel composed like a work of art.\n\nFor visitors, the experience is polished and personable: manageable scale, strong interpretive labels, and a pace that suits both a quick cultural stop and a deeper half-day. If you’re planning a New England itinerary, the Currier is an excellent anchor—an art museum where the galleries satisfy and the architecture becomes part of the collection.",
