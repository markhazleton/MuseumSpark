Please be aware if you add the John Paul Jones House on a 230pm tour you must see it first. It was closed after our tour but the society staff refunded us. And we enjoyed visiting with them at the lovely gift shop. Next visit we will see all the old homes that were pointed out on the tour and go to Strawberry Banke.

Known for its thoughtfully curated galleries and a strong regional backbone, the Currier pairs European and American painting with standout modernism and design. Add two Frank Lloyd Wright homes you can tour, and you get a visit that’s as much about space and light as it is about masterpieces—ideal for travelers who like to linger, look closely, and leave inspired.",
      "content_description": "**The Currier Museum of Art** is one of New England’s most rewarding regional museums: compact enough to feel personal, yet ambitious in scope and curatorial polish. Its galleries typically move fluidly between European and American painting, with notable strengths in **19th- and 20th-century art**—including works associated with *Impressionism*, *modernism*, and American realism—presented in a way that rewards slow looking. For travelers, the pleasure is in the pacing: you can take in high-caliber paintings, prints, and sculpture without the sensory overload of a mega-institution, and the museum’s interpretive approach tends to be clear, confident, and visitor-friendly.\n\nArchitecture is part of the appeal. The museum campus combines a refined, modern presentation with spaces designed to keep the focus on art—clean sightlines, strong natural and controlled lighting, and an atmosphere that encourages return visits. The signature experience, however, extends beyond the galleries: the Currier is renowned for its **Frank Lloyd Wright house tours**—two nearby Wright-designed homes that offer an immersive encounter with *Usonian* ideals, where built-in furnishings, warm materials, and choreographed movement through rooms make architecture feel like a lived artwork.\n\nPlan to give yourself time for both museum and house tour(s). For art enthusiasts, it’s a satisfying day: serious objects, thoughtful installation, and an architectural side trip that makes the Currier feel uniquely Manchester—rooted in place, yet confidently connected to broader art history.",
