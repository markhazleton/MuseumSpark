At the Still, visitors will find a world-class collection gifted to the City and County of Denver, award-winning architecture, cross-disciplinary programs for all ages, and opportunities to explore their own creativity. Exhibitions stimulate curiosity, arouse emotions, and explore multiple perspectives. The Still invites visitors to refresh, recharge, and reconnect with joy.\n\n### Exploring **the Museum**\n\n#### Lower **Level**\n\nBegin your visit by watching a brief [eight-minute video](http://web.archive.org/web/20260101113137/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhyRzJhcDeI) in the lobby for an introduction to the Museum.\n\nAfter your visit, stop in the [Museum Shop](http://web.archive.org/web/20260101113137/https://shop.clyffordstillmuseum.org/) for a memento of your visit.\n\nThe displays, videos, and interactive features on the first floor will deepen your understanding of Still, his works, the abstract expressionist movement, and conservation efforts.\n\nGlimpse what goes on behind the scenes in the painting storage and conservation areas.
