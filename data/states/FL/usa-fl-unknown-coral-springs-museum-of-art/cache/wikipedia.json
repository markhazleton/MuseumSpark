  "extract": "Coral Springs is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the city had a population of 134,394. Approximately 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale, it is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area in South Florida. It has an arts center, history museum, is home to the Florida Panthers hockey team, hosts the \"Our Town\" annual festival and has Florida's only covered bridge. The city, officially chartered on July 10, 1963, was master-planned and primarily developed by Coral Ridge Properties, Inc., which was acquired by Westinghouse in 1966. The city's name is derived from the company's name, and was selected after several earlier proposals had been considered and rejected. Despite the name, there are no natural springs in the city; Florida's springs are found in the central and northern portions of the state. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s the young city grew rapidly, adding over 35,000 residents each decade. Coral Springs has strict building codes designed to maintain the city's distinctive aesthetic appeal. The city government's effective fiscal management has maintained high bond ratings, and the city has won accolades for its overall livability, its low crime rate, and its family-friendly orientation.",
