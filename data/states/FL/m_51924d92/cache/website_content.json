The story of Sanibel is told from the Calusa and Spanish eras to the early pioneer families who settled on the island in the 1800s. It tells of warriors, adventures, fishermen, farmers and proprietors.\n\nNine historic buildings were moved from their original sites. Each building has been restored to its original state. We also have a replica of a Packing House and Bailey’s garage. Volunteer docents share the stories of Sanibel with almost 10,000 visitors a year.\n\n**Join us as we follow the footsteps of the past.**\n\n[Learn More](/about-us/)\n\n[](/visit/)\n\n#### [Museum Tours](/visit/)\n\n[](/become-a-member/)\n\n#### [Become a Member](/become-a-member/)\n\n[](/events/)\n\n#### [Upcoming Events](/events/)\n\n[](/museum-gift-shop/)\n\n#### [Visit Gift Shop](/museum-gift-shop/)\n\n### Museum & Village Happenings\n\n[](https://sanibelmuseum.org/history-of-a-florida-cracker/)\n\n## [History of a Florida “Cracker”](https://sanibelmuseum.org/history-of-a-florida-cracker/)\n\nBefore tourism, theme parks, and booming cities, there was the Florida Cracker. “Crackers” are named from the sharp crack of long braided whip used by Florida cowmen to drive cattle through dense brush.\n...",
