  "extract": "The Florida Museum of Photographic Arts (FMoPA) is a museum exhibiting photographic art. FMoPA also operates outreach programs to educate children and adults. FMoPA is one of fewer than ten museums in the United States dedicated exclusively to photography and one of two such museums in Florida. In addition, the museum is home to community programs such as the Children's Literacy Through Photography program for at-risk children and adult photography classes, workshops, and children's summer camps. Following the museum's move in 2023, FMoPA is now situated in Ybor City. Prior to being renamed the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts in the summer of 2006, FMoPA was named the Tampa Gallery of Photographic Arts.",
