The park’s namesake, Henry Bradley Plant, was a sound businessman with a powerful vision who became one of the South’s wealthiest industrialists. Henry built Plant Park as a formal playground for the wealthy guests of his adjacent Tampa Bay Hotel. We’re delighted to have you join us on a stroll through historic Plant Park. As you enjoy your tour, be on the lookout for the numbers on site, which indicate the opportunity to listen for more detailed explanations of specific historic areas of the park​.
