  "extract": "The Foosaner Art Museum, formerly the Brevard Art Museum, was located along the Indian River in the Eau Gallie Arts District, 1463 Highland Avenue, Melbourne, Florida. Since opening in 1978 the Foosaner Art Museum amassed over 5,000 objects, spanning 20 centuries. These items formed the museum's Permanent Collection, reflecting not only the museum's interests and specialties, but also the lives of the people who lived in the community. Throughout the year, visitors could experience a changing selection of exhibitions. Rotating exhibitions of nationally and internationally recognized artists showcased contemporary trends and historical art movements as do the variety of exhibitions created from the museum's permanent collection. The Foosaner Art Museum's permanent collection was composed primarily of Modern and Contemporary Art and included the Enrique Conill Mendoza Collection of American Industrial Design and the world's largest collection of works by Ernst Oppler (German, 1897–1929).",
