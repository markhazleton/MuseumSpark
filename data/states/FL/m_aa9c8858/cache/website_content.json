The two countries had been on a collision course for decades, and now they were headed for a showdown, and the outcome would shape the world. Spanish wealth and power, as everyone knew (or thought they knew) was unlimited; her Armada would be invincible. England, in contrast, was a small island nation.

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. \n\nHistory is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were \"resolved\" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there.

Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials.
