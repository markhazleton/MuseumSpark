  "extract": "Goodwood Plantation (also known as Old Croom Mansion) was a mid-sized slave plantation that grew cotton on about 1,675 acres (7 km2) in central Leon County, Florida. It is located at 1600 Miccosukee Road. The plantation was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 1972. In 1824, in recognition of his military service during the Revolutionary War, the Marquis de Lafayette was granted a full township in the Florida Territory by the United States Congress. This tract was called the Lafayette Land Grant and encompassed over 23,000 acres. Lafayette never visited his property but designated an agent to sell parcels of it on his behalf. Hardy Croom purchased 2,400 acres from the Lafayette Grant and built Goodwood Plantation on it in 1834.",
