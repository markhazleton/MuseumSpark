  "hours_text": "#  Visit\n\nOn View Now: David Bowie Memphis Collection\n\n### — Now On view —\n\n## **Space Oddities: The Sequel**  \nMore Bowie| More Sottsass| More Memphis\n\n### **The definitive collection including objects from the estate of David Bowie**\n\n\"The Archer,\" one of David Bowie's own all-time favourite photographs of himself, was taken at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens in 1976. Photo by John Robert Rowlands\n\nDavid Bowie, mourned by the world on his passing in 2016, was one of the most radical figures in recent popular culture. Memphis, founded under the leadership of Ettore Sottsass in Milan in 1981, was the most radical of all design groups. This exhibition brings them together. Bowie built up an extensive body of Memphis work over the years — iconic works by Sottsass and his colleagues, including Michele De Lucchi, Nathalie DuPasquier, Shiro Kuramata, and Martine Bedin. This exhibition, the largest gathering of Memphis objects ever presented in an American museum, includes over 75 examples, many from Bowie’s private collection. It is a fabulous opportunity to see Memphis as it should be seen — in profusion — and to experience the private world of a great pop visionary.\n\n## EXPLORE THE EXHIBITION\n\n### click on any image below to learn more about each artist\n\n[ ](/martine-bedin)\n\nMartine Bedin\n\n[ ](/andrea-branzi)\n\nAndrea Branzi\n\n[ ](/aldo-cibic)\n\nAldo Cibic\n\n[ ](/michele-deluchhi)\n\nMichele De Lucchi\n\n[ ](/michael-graves)\n\nMichael Graves\n\n[ ](/massimo-iosa-ghini)\n\nMassimo Iosa-Ghini\n\n[ ...",
