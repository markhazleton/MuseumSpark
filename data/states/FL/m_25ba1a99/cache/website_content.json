  "accessibility_text": "# Accessibility\n\nWheelchair accessibility in some of our historic houses is limited due to door sizes, door thresholds, stairs, and other obstacles. A number of the historic houses have been modified to accommodate accessibility needs, and the UWF Historic Trust works hard to continually update all of the facilities. However, there are a few historic houses that are unable to be made fully accessible, as the necessary changes will significantly alter the buildings. If you need a wheelchair, one is available for use at the [Pensacola Museum of History](/plan-your-visit/museums-properties/pensacola-museum-of-history/).\n\nThe buildings that are wheelchair accessible and that have accessible bathrooms include: the [Pensacola Museum of History](/plan-your-visit/museums-properties/pensacola-museum-of-history/), the [Voices of Pensacola](/plan-your-visit/museums-properties/voices-of-pensacola/), the [Pensacola Children’s Museum](/plan-your-visit/museums-properties/pensacola-childrens-museum/), the [Museum of Commerce](/plan-your-visit/museums-properties/museum-of-commerce/), the [Museum of Industry](/plan-your-visit/museums-properties/museum-of-industry/), [Old Christ Church](/plan-your-visit/museums-properties/old-christ-church/), the L & N Marine Terminal, and the Bowden Building.\n\nThere are a number of designated handicapped parking spaces located in visitor parking lots and available in select on­street parking areas.\n\nPlease contact the UWF Historic Trust ([850.595.5985](tel:850...",
