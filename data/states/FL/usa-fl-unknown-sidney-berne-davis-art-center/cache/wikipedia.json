The winter estates of Thomas Edison (\"Seminole Lodge\") and Henry Ford (\"The Mangoes\") are major attractions. The city takes its name from a local former fort that was built during the Seminole Wars. The fort in turn took its name from Colonel Abraham Myers in 1850; Myers served in the United States Army, mostly the Quartermaster Department, in various posts from 1833 to 1861 and was the quartermaster general of the Confederate States Army from 1861 to 1864. Fort Myers has substantial African American and Latin American populations.
