  "meta_description": "Exploring the twelve unique galleries of the Harwood Museum of Art, you will experience a comprehensive story of art in Taos. Showing art ranging from the Taos Society of Artists to the Taos Moderns, from Pueblo to Hispano, from traditional to cutting edge, The Harwood not only represents these diverse artistic and cultural traditions, but shows you how they have influenced each other. The Agnes Martin Gallery is perhaps the most visited exhibition space at the Harwood. Comprised of seven of her later paintings, donated by the artist in 1994, Martin herself helped to design the gallery and spent many hours within the tranquil space. In addition, the Daniel W. Dietrich II Foundation has gifted Tundra to the Harwood, the last painting by Agnes Martin from the period during which she created her signature grid paintings. Accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, the Harwood is steward of a premier regional art collection of national importance. The Harwood’s Arthur Bell Auditorium offers outstanding cultural programming including concerts, films, and lectures. The Harwood Museum Store offers carefully selected jewelry, books, and art objects, many handcrafted by local artists. Located on historic Ledoux Street, the Museum is set within a more than 100 year old, fully restored adobe residence which is registered with both the National Register of Historic Places and the New Mexico Register of Cultural Properties. The Harwood is within walking distance of Taos Plaza and is an essential destination for the traveler who is captivated by the past while inspired by the present.",
