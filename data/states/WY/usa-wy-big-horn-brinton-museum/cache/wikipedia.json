  "extract": "The Quarter Circle A Ranch, formerly known as the Bradford Brinton Memorial Museum, is a museum and historic ranch located 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Big Horn, Wyoming. The ranch was built in 1893 by William Moncreiffe, a Scottish immigrant and successful businessman. In 1923, Bradford Brinton bought the ranch from Moncreiffe and expanded it to its current appearance. Brinton collected art and historical materials, particularly those relating to Native American history; after his death in 1936, his sister Helen converted the ranch to a museum displaying his collections. The Brinton Museum holds art, historic documents, books and furnishings that made up Bradford Brinton's original collection. The permanent collection is on display in long-term exhibitions in the new facility and its original setting in the Brinton Ranch House, and complemented by frequently changing exhibits featuring art of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.",
