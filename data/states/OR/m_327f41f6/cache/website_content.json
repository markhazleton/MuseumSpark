An out of control or disruptive animal may be required to leave the Museum if the handler is unable to reestablish control over the animal or stop the disruptive behavior. Out of control behaviors include consistent barking, lunging or being aggressive towards people, interfering with collections objects, stealing food, or urinating or defecating on the premises. If the animal’s behavior warrants its removal from the Museum, the animal’s handler can stay in the Museum without the animal.\n\n### Admission\n\nFree and open to the public, groups & families always welcome.\n\n### Hours\n\nTuesday through Satu...",
