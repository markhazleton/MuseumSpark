Our 295-acre campus is smack-dab in the middle of some of the most beautiful places to be outside anywhere. We jog in the morning, bike to school, and roll along 13th Avenue to meet friends. We ski down mountains, float down rivers, and play along the beaches on the weekends. From the moment you arrive, you’ll feel right at home. This place feels familiar, green, and friendly, but also modern, totally connected, and cosmopolitan. It’s kind of perfect—an extraordinary academic community surrounded by a quintessential college town. It’s alive with music, culture, food, art, and just the right amount of weird to keep things interesting.\n\n[Visit Campus](https://connect.uoregon.edu/portal/campus-tours?utm_source=website_visit&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=cta_visit_campus)\n\n[Self-Guided Tour](http://tourmaps.uoregon.edu?utm_source=website_visit&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=cta_selfguided_tour)\n\n[Explore Eugene](https://www.eugenecascadescoast.org?utm_source=website_visit&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=cta_explore_eugene)\n\n### What’s it reall...",
