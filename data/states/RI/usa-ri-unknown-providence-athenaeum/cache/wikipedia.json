The building is open to the public, but only members can check out items from the collection. The library was established in 1836 as a merger between two earlier subscription libraries: The Providence Library Company, founded in 1753, and the Providence Athenaeum, founded in 1831. It became \"The Providence Athenaeum\" by amendment to its charter in 1850.",
