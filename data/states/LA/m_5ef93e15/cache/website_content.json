Through historic interpretation and conservation along the Bayou Vermilion, we strive to educate guests on the interactions of these groups and the connections between past and contemporary folklife, thus empowering guests to apply these lessons from our shared histories. Since its opening in 1990, the historic village has become one of Lafayette’s premier tourist attractions welcoming more than 60,000 visitors each year from around the world.\n\nVermilionville sits on a beautiful tree-covered 23-acre site on the banks of the Bayou Vermilion with 19 attractions, including seven restored original homes with costumed artisans that provide demonstrations on crafts performed by the early settlers.
