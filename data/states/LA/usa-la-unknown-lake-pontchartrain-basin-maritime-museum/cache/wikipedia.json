  "extract": "Lake Pontchartrain ( PON-chə-trayn; French: Lac Pontchartrain) is an estuary located in southeastern Louisiana in the United States. It covers an area of 630 square miles (1,600 km2) with an average depth of 12 to 14 feet (3.7 to 4.3 m). Some shipping channels are kept deeper through dredging. It is roughly oval in shape, about 40 miles (64 km) from west to east and 24 miles (39 km) from south to north. As an estuary, its “Lake” title is a misnomer, but only a slight one, as its passage to the open sea is narrow. In descending order of area, the estuary is located in parts of six Louisiana parishes: St. Tammany, Orleans, Jefferson, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, and Tangipahoa. The water boundaries were defined in 1979 (see list of parishes in Louisiana). The estuary is crossed by the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, the longest continuous bridge over water in the world. A power line also crosses the estuary. Its towers stand on caissons in Lake Pontchartrain, and its length can be used to visually demonstrate the curvature of the Earth.",
