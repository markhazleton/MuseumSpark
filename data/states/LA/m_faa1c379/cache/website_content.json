LSHOF Foundation CEO Ronnie Rantz expressed appreciation for support received over the past two years.\n\n“Membership drive monies enabled the foundation to initiate upgrades at the museum which otherwise would not have been possible,” said Rantz, who noted that the museum located in the Natchitoches Historic District is now over 12 years old and will continue to require aesthetic and technology updates to keep it among the best in the country. Rantz also said that LSHOF Foundation funds helped with renovation at the museum in time for the 2025 induction weekend following an electrical fire in the building on January 5.\n\nThere are four levels of membership – Starter ($120), Captain ($240), All-Star ($500), and Hall of Famer ($1,000). Individuals and businesses can join with an annual payment or with a monthly bank draft for as little as $10-$20 per month. Payment can be made online at lasportshall.com or by sending a check to 500 Front Street, Natchitoches, LA 71457.\n\nEvery Year Three member will receive a newly created LSHOF 24” X 18” color poster featuring some of the most well-know...",
