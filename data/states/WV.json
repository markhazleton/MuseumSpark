The details in absolutely everything there were amazing. From the exhibits to the educational aspect, and they didn't forget to make it fun and memorable for the children as well. There is so much to see and learn. I honestly wish we could have had more time there, I'm sure I didn't see it all. But, the best part of my experience there was when I went into the church and met the most wonderful woman who I thought at first was a employee, like the others I found throughout, which mind you are all amazing in the educating of every aspect of the park, but after I listened to her tell me the story of the man who wanted that church built, and the story behind the church and then revealed it was her husband! The owner of this wonderful place was sitting in front of me telling me this story, not just one of the employees but the owner. She was a true joy to talk to. I walked out of there with goosebumps from head to toe in 98° weather! Truly, a touching experience I will carry with me. I highly recommend.",

You’ll come for the intimate galleries and rotating exhibitions, and stay for the museum’s standout displays of studio glass, decorative arts, and American art presented in a serene, park-like setting. It’s an easy, rewarding visit for art lovers who enjoy close looking, thoughtful curation, and the calm of a museum that never feels rushed.",
      "content_description": "Perched in a leafy setting, the **Huntington Museum of Art** offers the kind of satisfying, unhurried museum experience that rewards art travelers who like to look closely. The institution is best known for presenting a well-curated regional view of American art alongside a deep respect for the handmade object—an approach that makes the galleries feel both approachable and quietly scholarly. Expect a rotating calendar of exhibitions that keeps repeat visits fresh, from painting and photography to contemporary craft, often connecting broader art histories to Appalachian and Mid-Atlantic cultural currents.\n\nA particular strength is the museum’s attention to the *decorative arts* and the studio craft traditions that shaped 20th-century collecting. Displays of glass, ceramics, and design-forward objects invite you to slow down and appreciate technique—how light moves through glass, how glaze chemistry produces color, how ornament and function intersect. Painting and works on paper complement these holdings, creating a visit that balances “fine art” and *applied art* in a way many larger museums overlook.\n\nThe building and grounds enhance the experience: **daylit galleries**, a calm, human-scale layout, and the sense of arriving at a cultural retreat rather than a crowded attraction. For art enthusiasts, it’s ideal for a half-day itinerary—pairing gallery time with a stroll outdoors and the pleasure of discovering a museum whose strongest moments are often in the details: materials, processes, and the regional stories they carry.",

          "text": "Caught the Eagles tribute band, Out Of Eden at the Clay Center. Band played and sounded amazing. The venue usually sounds amazing though.\n\nI noticed they're allowing drinks (including alcohol) inside the theater now, I'm hoping that doesn't spoil the theater over time. I noticed a group of drinking women climbing over the seat rows with their drinks instead of entering their aisles. I dread once more maintenance is required, the cost of enjoying a show will rise. Anyhow..\n\nThere were a mix of older and younger band members. A guitar teacher and his son were members and one of the teacher's students was playing along in the band. I think his name was Jack, but they said he was 20yrs old but he played as well as anyone else there. A drummer mentioned he'd only been with the band 3yrs, but you would never known. He played and sang the Don Henley parts so well with the band, you would've thought he'd been with the band a lot longer.\n\nMost of the band members treated performing just like the Eagles, by playing multiple instruments and singing lead. I thought that was really cool. And the setlist was looked at like them too, offering songs from member's solo projects. I really liked that they played \"Boys of Summer\", I've always liked that song.\n\nThe crowd was into the music and the band was into the crowd. The band was hanging out with everyone in the lobby after the show, really nice guys.  It was said that most if not all of the band members were from Ohio. So they'll be chances to see them again. If you like the music of the Eagles, go to see them, you'll enjoy it.",

The museum has 3 levels with the bottom 2 being science-related exhibits & the top floor being a large art exhibit. There are a ton of hands-on experiences that are great for kids of all ages & enough to keep everyone engaged for at minimum a couple hours. Building was clean, well designed with plenty of space to move around & very affordable considering everything you can find & enjoy there. 10/10 recommend if you’re in the area ✌🏻",
