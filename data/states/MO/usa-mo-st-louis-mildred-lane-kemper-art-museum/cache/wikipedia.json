  "extract": "The Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum is an art museum located on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, within the university's Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts. Founded in 1881 as the St. Louis School and Museum of Fine Arts, it was initially located in downtown St. Louis. It is the oldest art museum west of the Mississippi River. The Museum holds 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century European and American paintings, sculptures, prints, installations, and photographs. The collection also includes some Egyptian and Greek antiquities and Old Master prints. The museum moved to its current home, designed by Pritzker Prize-winner Fumihiko Maki, in 2006. In 2018 the museum was closed for renovation as part of a $360 million campus transformation program at Washington University in St. Louis. One year later, it was reopened with a new 34-foot-tall polished stainless-steel facade, a sculpture garden, and nearly 50 percent more public display space.",
