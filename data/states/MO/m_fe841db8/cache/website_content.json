  "collections_text": "Established in 1969 as the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library in the United States and renamed by act of Congress in 2009 as \"America's National Churchill Museum,\" the museum and historic site is the nation's leading institution dedicated to remembering and honoring the life and enduring legacy of British Statesman Winston S. Churchill.\n\nThe Museum, located on the campus of Westminster College, was created after a national campaign chaired by U.S. Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Eisenhower and Truman to memorialize the speech Churchill gave at the school on March 5, 1946.\n\nThe Museum includes the majestic 17th-century church of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury created by British architect Sir Christopher Wren. Bombed and badly damaged in the Second World War, the building was relocated from London to Fulton, Missouri, in the 1960s to honor Churchill's speech at Westminster College.\n\nThe Museum also includes the largest continuous section of the Berlin Wall in North America, which is now a sculpture by Edwina Sandys, granddaughter of Winston Churchill.",
