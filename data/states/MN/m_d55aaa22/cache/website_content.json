  "hours_text": "# Hours & Directions\n\n**Welcome to the M!** Located in the historic Pioneer Endicott building in the heart of downtown St. Paul, the M always has something you’ve never seen before. All are welcome, so visit the M today.\n\n#### \n\n#### **Transit Information:**\n\nThe Metro Green Line stops just a block from the M’s front door (Central Station). Several bus lines also stop close by; visit [metrotransit.org](http://www.metrotransit.org/) to plan your trip. If you are using public transit, a transportation service, or parking at a paid meter near the M, go to the M’s main entrance at 350 Robert Street N entrance to access the museum. This is the closest public entrance to the museum. \n\nThe M does not have a designated parking lot. If you park in a ramp, the Jackson Street Ramp at 345 Jackson Street is closest. Ramp includes van accessible spaces and elevators on each floor which can be accessed via a curb cut to the sidewalk and manual door. Guests should be aware of a steep incline within the ramp. From the parking ramp, take the elevator to skyway level 3A. Once you have entered the skyway on 3A, additional signage will direct you to the M. \n\n#### **Parking is available in the following locations:**\n\n  * Paid meter parking on the streets surrounding the museum, most reliably on Kellogg Blvd., one block away from the M \n  * [Jackson Street Ramp](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jackson+Street+Ramp/@44.9464119,-93.0925956,16z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x87f7d54c2aebe305:0xf53840dc2163b2e...",
