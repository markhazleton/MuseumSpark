  "extract": "The Gichigamiin Indigenous Nations Museum is a museum in Evanston, Illinois that focuses exclusively on the history, culture and arts of North American native peoples. The museum was established as the Mitchell Museum of the American Indian in 1977. In 2024, the museum was renamed and became Native-led, shifting its mission from an overview of U.S. and Canadian Indigenous peoples to a more specific focus on Chicago's Native community and the tribal nations across the Great Lakes region. The museum's collection of over 10,000 items ranges from the Paleo-Indian period through the present day. Permanent exhibitions depict the Native American cultures of the Woodlands, Plains, Southwest, Northwest Coast and Arctic regions. Special exhibit areas highlight the work of contemporary regional Native artists.",
