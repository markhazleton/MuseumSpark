  "extract": "The Midwest Museum of Natural History was a 501(c)3 organization located in Sycamore, Illinois, United States. In 1875, the structure was built as the home of the Universalist Church in Sycamore. In the 1920s the building underwent dramatic changes, becoming the Sycamore Community Center, complete with basketball courts, a swimming pool, and hip hangout, Teen Town. In February 2004, this 129-year-old building was overhauled once again with a top-to-bottom 1.2 million dollar renovation. This included the creation of exhibit halls, classrooms, offices, collection storage, and a new roof and climate controls to help preserve the museum's specimens. The museum closed permanently in February 2020.",
