We will reopen Saturday, February 14 at 10 A.M.**\n\nIn 1668, merchan ad ship-owner John Turner built a house on Salem Harbor destined to become one of America’s most beloved historic homes. Designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2007, The House of the Seven Gables is best known today as the inspiration for world-renowned American author Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1851 novel. In 1910, Salem activist and philanthropist Caroline Emmerton restored the house and opened it as a museum and Settlement House to support the local immigrant community. Over a century later, The House of the Seven Gables Settlement Association carries on Emmerton’s mission and vision by offering free English as a Second Language and Citizenship classes and providing a platform for immigrant voices on the North Shore.
