  "extract": "Lexington History Museums, previously known as the Lexington Historical Society, is a non-profit historic preservation and interpretation organization headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts. Founded in 1886, it conserves and celebrates Lexington's history, with a special emphasis on the town's important role in the beginning of the American Revolution. The Society manages three nationally historic house museums: the Hancock–Clarke House, Paul Revere's Lexington destination; Buckman Tavern, the gathering place of the Lexington militia on April 19, 1775; and Munroe Tavern, temporary British field headquarters during the retreat from Concord to Boston. The Society's offices are located at the Lexington Depot, itself a museum of the town's history, located at 13 Depot Square in Lexington Centre. The Society also maintains an extensive collection of artifacts and archives. An important part of the Society's mission is educational programs that focus on colonial life and the American Revolution for elementary, middle and high school students. The Society presents educational programs year-round in the restored Lexington Depot. The Depot is available for rental by Lexington community groups, residents and businesses.",
