The collections have grown to more than 750,000 objects, including manuscripts, books, photographs, maps, decorative arts, and other artifacts related to the history of Beverly and the North Shore. The Society acquired two 17th century properties in the 1930s, the John Balch House and the John Hale House, which it opens to the public for guided tours. Throughout its history, the Society has collected, preserved and interpreted Beverly history, offering programs to the general public, as well as to teachers and students. Volunteers are critically important to the vitality and success of the Beverly Historical Society; contributed hours in 2008 exceeded 4800. In order to meet the needs of a diverse and changing constituency, the Society is focused on digitizing our collections and offering more services online to increase access to the collections, as well as increasing the amount of free programming offered each year. The Society's collections include manuscripts, books, photographs, maps, ephemera, decorative arts, and other artifacts related to the history of Beverly and the North Shore of Massachusetts.",
