  "hours_text": "# Our Historic Properties\n\n### Travel Back in Time\n\nThe Needham History Center & Museum is located in the renovated Matthias Mills House (1834) and Upper Falls Schoolhouse (1842). Both historic properties were moved from their original locations on Central Avenue, to their new location at 1147 Central Avenue in 2006.\n\nThe Mills House and Schoolhouse provide generous space for the History Center’s exhibits, programs, and research. Part of the structure is an old one-room schoolhouse, with bright red paint on the outside to the chalkboard and old wood stove inside. The Schoolhouse is also the location of our famous third-grade program, the 1850s Schoolhouse Day, and a favored location for receptions and events. The Mattias Mills House is now home the many artifacts of Needham’s past and provides an antique setting for the many exhibits.\n\n### Visit Us! \n\nWe gladly and unreservedly make our resources available to any party interested in the town’s heritage.
