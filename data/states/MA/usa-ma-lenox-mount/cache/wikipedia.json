The property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. Today, The Mount is a cultural center and historic house museum, welcoming over 50,000 visitors each year.

Interpretive exhibits throughout the house explore Wharton and her servants’ lives, as well as her humanitarian efforts and literary legacy. The Mount also presents lectures, dramatic readings, theater, music, storytelling, workshops, outdoor sculptures, films, and literary panels with over 40 local partner organizations.",
