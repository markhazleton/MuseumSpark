  "accessibility_text": "# “Ansel Adams, Environmentalist and Photographer”: A Slide Lecture by Lance Hidy\n\n#### Saturday, November 3, 2018\n\n _Free and open to the public_\n\nPhotographer Ansel Adams (1902–1984) devoted his life to sharing the transformative power of wilderness through his art, and to leading the environmental movement. Speaker Lance Hidy was chosen by Adams to collaborate on the final book of his career, _Yosemite and the Range of Light_ (1979). Hidy continues to design the official Ansel Adams books for the Ansel Adams Trust and publisher Little, Brown & Company. Through his first-hand experience, Hidy brings a personal perspective to the Ansel Adams story.\n\nIn his lifetime Adams shot over 40,000 photographs; he produced several dozen books that have sold over a million copies; he cofounded the first museum department of photography at the Museum of Modern Art; and, for nearly 40 years he was a leader in the Sierra Club. The lecture is enlivened by quotes from Adams’ autobiography, and by dozens of his finest photographs.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale and cofounding the Boston publishing firm of David R. Godine, Hidy established his own design studio in 1973, where he expanded his practice to include posters, illustration, and photog­raphy, while incorporating his love of printmaking with his training in letter forms. Hidy’s writings on design history and practice have been widely published.\n\nA former art director of Harvard Business Review, he designed the typeface Penumbra for Adobe,...",

Lane Turner/Globe Staff\n\nStored and forgotten in a cramped closet in a South End basement, a 200-year-old printing press — 600 pounds of iron, wood, and plenty of dust — lurched recently toward a new chapter in its long and mysterious life.\n\nHauled onto makeshift dollies at Franklin Cummings Tech, a two-year trade college, this throwback innovation from the early 19th century attracted a gaggle of admirers as it rolled toward a moving van parked on nearby, cobblestone alley.\n\nThe press, built by Adam Ramage of Philadelphia in about 1815, is among only two or three believed to remain in existence, according to Mitchel Ahern, operations director at the Museum of Printing in Haverhill.\n\nAs Ahern helped extract the machine, broad smiles and compliments from movers and school staff greeted the press as it slowly emerged from its hideaway.\n\n“Very cool,” cooed Ahern, who said the press willreceive star treatment among the museum’s displays of printing’s centuries-long evolution.\n\n“It’s really exciting to see a press like this pop up,” Ahern said. “In its day, this was printing technology. Our mission is to keep this kind of thing out of landfills.”\n\nIts recent discov...",
