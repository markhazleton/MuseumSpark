The museum is a great size and can be done in a few hours and has a sculpture garden as well (can't wait to visit in the spring).

And if you want even more, head over to nearby Rockford Park.\n\nEven though there were no tours on the Saturday I went, the sweet person from whom I bought the tix was so knowledgeable. I really appreciate that she understood my frustration with the website and shared that similar feedback has already been shared with IT. She also suggested other area museums I may enjoy based on my preferences.",

The scale is manageable but rewarding—ideal for slow looking—while the building’s bright, renovated spaces and sculpture garden make it as pleasant to wander as it is to study.",
      "content_description": "**Delaware Art Museum** is one of the Mid-Atlantic’s most satisfying “discoveries”: a regional museum with **national-caliber strengths**. Its signature holdings spotlight **British Pre-Raphaelite art**—the luminous, detail-driven paintings and works on paper associated with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, and their circle—bringing *Victorian* imagination, medieval revivalism, and symbol-laden storytelling into crisp focus. Equally compelling is the museum’s deep commitment to Delaware’s artistic legacy through **Howard Pyle** and the Brandywine tradition of illustration, where you’ll see how narrative drawing shaped American visual culture—from swashbuckling adventure imagery to the refined craft of book and magazine art.\n\nThe museum’s campus-like setting along Kentmere Parkway suits its role as a place to linger. Renovated galleries emphasize **clear sightlines, generous light, and a calm rhythm of rooms**—a welcome environment for close study of works on paper, jewel-toned paintings, and rotating presentations that often connect historic storytelling with contemporary themes. Outdoors, a **sculpture garden** extends the visit with fresh air and art in conversation.\n\nFor travelers planning a museum day in Wilmington, the experience feels curated for enthusiasts: you can move from *Pre-Raphaelite* ideals to American illustration and onward to modern and contemporary works without fatigue. Expect a visit that rewards attention to technique—line, surface, and narrative—while offering the ease, comfort, and intimacy that larger encyclopedic museums sometimes lack.",

The building is not huge but they really cover a lot in there. They have it broken down into section, with various geographical locations specified. When we were there they had an animatronic dinosaur exhibit on display. There was also a room where the kids could see a live turtle, snake and tarantula. They have a nice gift shop and also a place to eat. Admission was around $30 per person. There is an outdoor area as well but it was raining when we were there.",

I couldn't believe they didn't charge entry but simply recommended donations. I think it's worth the trip and donations to keep this valuable resource in the community! By the way, they have a store where I honestly had to stop myself from buying too many things.\n\nAs far as the art being showcased this season, it had interesting installations and interactives from 16 artists. I felt it called upon our curiosity and open-mindedness to observe and understand some of the topics woven through the art. I will admit this was a good experience for me because I'm not typically a fan of contemporary art.\n\nI wanted to open myself up to new experiences.

      "content_description": "**The Delaware Contemporary** offers a compelling snapshot of art in the present tense—less a “treasure vault” than a vibrant platform for evolving ideas. As a regional contemporary art museum, its strengths lie in **rotating exhibitions** and an emphasis on living artists, often pairing Delaware and Mid-Atlantic talent with broader national perspectives. Expect an engaging range of media—painting, photography, sculpture, and installation—where curatorial themes help you connect the dots between material experimentation, social questions, and the visual language of today. Rather than building around a fixed canon, the museum rewards curiosity and repeat visits, since what you see changes meaningfully over the year.\n\nArchitecturally, the experience is designed around looking: **clean-lined galleries**, flexible exhibition spaces, and a layout that prioritizes clear sightlines and close viewing—especially satisfying for contemporary work where surface, scale, and process are part of the message. The overall atmosphere feels approachable and current, with a pace that suits travelers: you can do a focused visit in an hour, or linger to read wall texts and trace an exhibition’s argument.\n\nFor art enthusiasts planning a Wilmington itinerary, **The Delaware Contemporary** works best as a “right-now” counterpoint to more encyclopedic museums. Go with the mindset of discovery—seek out the most ambitious installation on view, spend time with photographic series and works on paper, and let the museum’s changing program introduce you to artists you may not have encountered yet.",

      "content_summary": "Set in downtown Dover, the Biggs Museum of American Art is a rewarding stop for travelers who want a focused, intimate look at American creativity with a distinct Delaware point of view. Expect thoughtfully curated galleries that spotlight regional history alongside broader national stories in painting, sculpture, and decorative arts. It’s the kind of local museum that rewards close looking—easy to navigate, rarely overwhelming, and ideal for pairing with Dover’s historic sites for a full day of culture.",
      "content_description": "In the heart of downtown Dover, the **Biggs Museum of American Art** offers art lovers a satisfying, gallery-to-gallery encounter with American art—especially when you’re curious about how national styles and ideas take root in a specific place. As a local institution with a moderate-sized collection, Biggs excels at the pleasures of *close looking*: you can spend time with individual works, notice materials and technique, and follow how American visual culture shifts across centuries without the fatigue that can come with larger encyclopedic museums.\n\nThe museum’s strengths typically center on American traditions you can experience at human scale—think *portraiture*, *landscape*, and objects that bridge art and craft through American decorative arts. For visitors, the Delaware emphasis is part of the appeal: you’ll often find exhibitions and collection displays that connect the region’s history, people, and material culture to wider currents in American art. Rotating shows and focused installations keep repeat visits fresh, while interpretive texts tend to be approachable for both newcomers and seasoned museum-goers.\n\nArchitecturally and experientially, Biggs feels designed for an unhurried visit. Its downtown location makes it easy to combine with Dover’s walkable civic and historic core, turning a museum stop into a broader itinerary of architecture, heritage, and local food. Come with an eye for detail—brushwork, carving, glazing, patina—and you’ll leave with a richer sense of how American art is built not only in major capitals, but also in places like Dover where local identity remains visible in the collection.",
