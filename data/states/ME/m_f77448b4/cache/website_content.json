  "hours_text": "## About the Penobscot Marine Museum\n\n## The Museum\n\nAs one of the nation’s oldest maritime museums, Penobscot Marine Museum has a unique campus of historical homes and buildings in Searsport, Maine. The museum displays and shares art, objects, documents, and small boats that tell the tales of the state’s many coastal communities. \n\nIn-person visitors explore Maine’s many working waterfronts and become familiar with the people who have populated them, past and present. Hands-on exhibits, historical artifacts, fine art, and a research library are all housed in centuries-old structures situated in the small downtown of a historic community. From raising a sail, singing a sea chantey, or reading a seaman’s diary to seeing the tools and jigs of renowned boatbuilders, guests become immersed in the lineage of captains, sailors, and their families while on campus. \n\nOnline visitors join lectures and workshops broadcast to the public, and also search historical databases of photography, documents, and information. All of the Penobscot Marine Museum offerings serve to spread the stories of the tightly-knit communities of Mainers whose lives and livelihoods have long been sustained on or by the sea.\n\n[View Our Strategic Plan](http://web.archive.org/web/20260101061602/https://penobscotmarinemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Strategic-Plan.pdf)\n\nPenobscot Marine Museum is Accredited by the Alliance of American Museums.
