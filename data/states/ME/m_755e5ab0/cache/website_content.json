Your gift, regardless of size, will be both welcome and important to the Museum as it plans for the future.\n\nYou are strongly urged to discuss your gift intentions with the Museum at an early stage in your planning. Please call us at 207-244-9242, or have your attorney or financial advisor call if you have any questions or would like additional information.\n\n### Gift Planning Options\n\n**Bequests:**  \nA bequest is a gift of cash, property, or other assets given to the Museum through a will. A bequest allows you to give a substantial contribution without impacting your current assets. A gift to the Museum is deductible against estate taxes.
