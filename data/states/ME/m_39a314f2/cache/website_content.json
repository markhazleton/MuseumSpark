At the Abbe's downtown museum, visitors find dynamic and stimulating exhibitions and activities interspersed with spaces for quiet reflection. The history and cultures of the Native people in what we now know as Maine, the Wabanaki, are showcased through changing exhibitions, special events, teacher workshops, and workshops for children and adults. \n\n> “The museum is heartfelt, accessible, and has something for all visitors but doesn’t shy away from telling the hard truths of the past and present. We are all involved in the process of making the world better. Thank you for the opportunity to learn and appreciate, to recognize beauty and work, and the unity of all things.” —Emma, 2018\n\n* * *\n\n## Plan Your Visit\n\n[ ](/two-locations)\n\nThe Abbe Museum is open seasonally from May - October.
