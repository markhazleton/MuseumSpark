In the early 2000’s the organization’s name was changed to Arts on Grand for their new location on Grand Ave. Arts on Grand is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.\n\nToday, Arts on Grand continues to promote and present local artists and musicians, with a mission of enriching the lives of N.W. Iowans through the arts. We offer a variety of classes throughout the year for both children and adults.\n\nOur exhibit gallery hosts a variety of different artists and art, from color pencil to pastel artists. We also offer live music in our gallery from local musicians. A gift shop offers art, books and other items from local and Midwestern artists and authors.\n\n## [ABOUT US ](http://web.archive.org/web/20251119045048/https://www.artsongrand.org/about-us/)\n\n## [CONTACT US ](http://web.archive.org/web/20251119045048/https://www.artsongrand.org/contact-us/)\n\n## Upcoming EVEN...",
