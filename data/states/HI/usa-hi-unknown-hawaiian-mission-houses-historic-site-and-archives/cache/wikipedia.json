  "extract": "The Hawaiian Mission Houses Historic Site and Archives in Honolulu, Hawaii, was established in 1920 by the Hawaiian Mission Children's Society, a private, non-profit organization and genealogical society, on the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the first Christian missionaries in Hawaiʻi. In 1962, the Mission Houses, together with Kawaiahaʻo Church, both built by those early missionaries, were jointly designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL). In 1966 all the NHLs were included in the National Register of Historic Places. The Hawaiian Mission Houses Historic Site and Archives collects, preserves, interprets, and exhibits documents, artifacts, and other records of Hawaii's \"missionary\" period from about 1820 to 1863. It interprets its historic site and collections and makes these collections available for research, educational purposes, and public enjoyment. The archive's collection holds over 3,000 Hawaiian, Western, and Pacific artifacts, and more than 12,000 books, manuscripts, original letters, diaries, journals, illustrations and Hawaiian church records. The Hawaiian Mission Houses has an ongoing digitization project. As part of this effort, after the devastating 2023 fire in Lāhainā they have uploaded items relevant to Lāhainā's history, such as photos, journals, drawings, and letters, to aid in the eventual recovery of the historic town.",
