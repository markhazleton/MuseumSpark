Every day, creativity weaves its way across campus, transforming each of us: keiki gain confidence and find their voices through art, music, and dance; adults and kūpuna reconnect with their roots and uncover new parts of themselves through artistic expression; workshops offer space to learn, reflect, and create; and exhibitions and cultural events unite us through shared stories and diverse voices, all strengthening the bonds that make us a community.\n\n**Creativity isn’t separate from life—it _is_ life. **Be part of the Mill’s story.\n\n[GIVE TODAY](http://web.archive.org/web/20260103003709/https://bit.ly/MillAnnualFund2025)\n\n## Happening Now\n\n[All classes & events >](/web/20260103003709/https://donkeymillartcenter.org/happening-now/)\n\nFiber Arts\n\n[](/web/20260103003709/https://donkeymillartcenter.org/event/?event=6572)\n\n### KITE00: Papermaking and Kite-Making\n\nwith BEAM Studio\n\nJanuary 10, 2026 – January 11, 2026\n\n[Learn More >](/web/20260103003709/https://donkeymillartcenter.org/event/?event=6572)\n\nYouth...",
