It was built in 1843 by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Henry Baldwin, who died within months of its completion. After Baldwin's death, the house was used as a girls' school until it was sold to local businessman William Reynolds in 1847. The house now serves as a museum. The Baldwin–Reynolds House offers free tours in the summer. It was home to two mayors. The Crawford County Historical Society purchased the home in 1963.",
