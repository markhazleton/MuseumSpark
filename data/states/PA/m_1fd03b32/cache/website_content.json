With its huge doorway fan light (the largest in any Pennsylvania residence in 1786) plus grand proportions and straight, classical lines, Physick House is an exceptional example of the Federal style. It is decorated with outstanding examples of French-influenced Neoclassic furnishings, popular during Dr. Physick's time in the house. The unusually large city garden also contains plants popular in the 19th century.\n\nThe house remained in the family, passing through various relations of Dr. Physick. Philip Syng Physick Randolph I sold the property to Elise Wister Keith in 1895. Elise and her husband Charles Penrose Keith lived in the house until their deaths (in 1938 & 1940). The house is also referred to as the Hill/Physick/Keith House. \n\n[](http://web.archive.org/web/20221201165801/https://roundme.com/tour/195802/view/520308/)\n\n## LOCATION\n\n321 South 4th Street  \nPhiladelphia, PA 19106\n\n​\n\nIf you are interested in renting Hill-Physick House for a [Private E...",
