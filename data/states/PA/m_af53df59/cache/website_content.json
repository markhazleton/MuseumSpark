Additional restrooms are available in the Edible Garden classroom at the bottom of the hill adjacent to the pond. Please note there are no other restroom facilities on the trails.\n\n## ******Accessibility**\n\nTyler offers level and ramped access on paved paths through most of the inner core of our 650 acres site. There is level and gently ramped access from our parking lot, through our Visitor Center, to the main historic core of the site. Access to the lower and upper floors of the barn is either level or ramped. \n\nOur Scenic Loop is paved and mostly level although parts of the path include bridges over stream crossings, along with a few moderate grades. \n\nIn several of our garden areas paths are commonly grassed or mulched with bark chippings which may offer limited accessibility for visitors who are wheelchair users. \n\nOur Fragrant Garden (located on the lower terrace to the side of the Barn) offers seasonal experiences for all visitors but may be particularly attractive to visitors with low vision or who are blind or partially sighted. While Tyler’s hiking trails are well-maintained, they are unpaved and may be best accessed by visitors with disabilities who are accompanied by a companion.\n\nAccessibility2019-12-10T13:54:...",
