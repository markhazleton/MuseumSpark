  "extract": "The Rosenbach is a Philadelphia museum and library located within two 19th-century townhouses. Established as a testamentary gift in 1954, the historic houses contain the donated collections of Dr. Abraham Simon Wolf Rosenbach and his brother Philip H. Rosenbach. The Rosenbach offers virtual and on-site programs, including tours, courses, book clubs, and a free weekly web series called Biblioventures, inspired by its collection. The Rosenbach is Philadelphia's home for Bloomsday, a festival celebrating James Joyce's Ulysses every June 16. The brothers owned the Rosenbach Company, which was a prominent dealer of rare books, manuscripts, and decorative arts during the first half of the 20th century. Dr. Rosenbach in particular was seminal in the rare book world, helping to build libraries such as the Widener Library at Harvard, The Huntington Library and the Folger Shakespeare Library. In 2013, the Rosenbach became a subsidiary of the Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation, but maintains its own board and operates independently of the public library system.",
