  "extract": "The Frick Pittsburgh is a cluster of museums and historical buildings located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, and formed around the Frick family's nineteenth-century residence known as \"Clayton\". It focuses on the interpretation of the life and times of Henry Clay Frick (1849–1919), industrialist and art collector. The complex, located on 5.5 acres (22,000 m2) of lawn and gardens in the city's Point Breeze neighborhood, includes Clayton, the restored Frick mansion; The Frick Art Museum; The Car and Carriage Museum; the Greenhouse; the Frick children's playhouse; and The Café. The site welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year. Admission is free to the gardens, the permanent collection of the Frick Art Museum, and certain areas of the Car and Carriage Museum, but fees do apply in order to view special exhibitions at both of the museums as well as for tours of Clayton. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2025. Helen Clay Frick (1888–1984) was the driving force to preserve the Frick estate and allow it to open to the public after her death.",
