  "extract": "The National Museum of Industrial History, abbreviated NMIH, housed in the former facility of Bethlehem Steel in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is a museum affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution that seeks to preserve, educate, and display the industrial history of the nation. It holds a collection of artifacts from the textile, steel and iron, and propane gas industries. The museum holds a significant collection of industrial machinery on loan from the institute's National Museum of American History. The museum also has a large collection of documents, machinery, photographs, and other archival material from Bethlehem Steel, one of the world's largest steel manufacturers prior to its 2001 bankruptcy and 2003 dissolution. The museum opened in August 2016 with the goal to \"forge a connection between America's industrial past and the innovations of today by educating the public and inspiring the visionaries of tomorrow\". The $7.5 million museum has four exhibitions, each focusing on a different aspect of industrial history that affected both Pennsylvania and the rest of the country. The museum showcases the nation's industrial past by highlighting the machinery and the lives of workers at that time period.",
