But it was Isaac’s son Anthony who would earn the legendary moniker “Mad\" Anthony Wayne as he served with General Washington and Lafayette, helping lead the battles of Brandywine and Germantown. \n\nThe Valley Forge encampment was a mere five miles from his doorstep. By the end of the War for Independence, General Wayne became a bonafide national hero, and is today still credited as one of the greatest fighting generals in American History. \n\nIn all, seven generations of Waynes lived on site until 1965. Visitors to this beautiful Georgian manor will find a fascinating collection of 18th and 19th C. family items, including General Wayne’s personal map from the Paoli Massacre. \n\n[Private Event Rental](http://web.archive.org/web/20221201164819/https://www.philalandm...",
