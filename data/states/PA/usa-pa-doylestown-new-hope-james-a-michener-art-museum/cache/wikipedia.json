Founded in 1988, it was named for the Pulitzer Prize–winning writer James A. Michener, a Doylestown resident. Situated within the old stone walls of an historic nineteenth-century prison, it houses a collection of Bucks County visual arts, along with holdings of nineteenth- and twentieth-century American art, and is noted for its Pennsylvania Impressionism collection and an art colony centered in nearby New Hope during the early 20th century, as well as its changing exhibitions, ranging from international touring shows to regionally focused exhibitions.",
