As newlyweds, he and his new bride, Elizabeth Willing Powel, immediately began redesigning the house’s interior. The Powels hired Philadelphia’s leading carvers and craftsmen to decorate the house’s principal rooms. James Claw created the elaborate Rococo design of the carved ceilings in the ballroom. Hercules Courtenay carved the exquisite ornamental mantel, along with the cornices, paneling and baseboards. Nicholas Bernard and Martin Jugiez carved the stunning mahogany staircase.\n\nSamuel Powel is often called the “Patriot Mayor,” serving as the last mayor under the British Crown and the first mayor in our new American republic. Powel was not only a real estate mogul, land investor, merchant, politician, and trustee, but he was among the richest men in Philadelphia. \n\nHis wife Elizabeth Willing Powel was an equally seminal figure in our country’s founding. She not only lavishly entertained the political elite during the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, but she was also educated, smart, and had a powerful, opinionated voice.
