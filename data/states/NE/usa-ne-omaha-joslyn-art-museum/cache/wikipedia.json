  "extract": "The Joslyn Art Museum, commonly referred to as the Joslyn, is a fine arts museum in Omaha, Nebraska, the largest in the state. It opened in 1931 at the initiative of Sarah H. Joslyn, in memory of her husband, businessman George A. Joslyn. Since its opening, the museum has gone through several expansions, the last of which was completed in 2024. It is the only museum in Nebraska with a comprehensive permanent collection, comprising over 12,000 objects, including nineteenth and twentieth-century collections of American and European art, Western American Art, Chinese and Japanese art, as well as contemporary art. The Joslyn is home to the Margre H.
