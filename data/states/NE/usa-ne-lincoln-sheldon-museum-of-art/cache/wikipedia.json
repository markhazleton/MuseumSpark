  "extract": "The Sheldon Museum of Art (formerly the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery) is an art museum on the campus of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in Lincoln, Nebraska. The museum was established in 1963 when the university's art collection was moved to dedicated building at 451 North 12th Street. The building, designed by architect Philip Johnson and funded by siblings Mary Frances and Adams Bromley Sheldon, is made of Italian travertine, featuring a grand hall and distinctive central staircase. The museum focuses on nineteenth- and twentieth-century art and houses over 12,000 artworks spanning multiple American art movements. An outdoor sculpture garden features more than thirty large-scale works. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.",
