It was the final work of architect William Buckland. With its carved doorway entrance, formal rooms, and elegant scale, the building blends the artistry of the finest Anglo-Palladian architecture with American sensibility.\n\nThe house is open to the public for tours. Subjects include the social history of the families and enslaved people who lived in the house, architecture, and the collection of fine and decorative art. Numerous special tours, lectures, talks, concerts, and family programs are scheduled throughout the year.\n\nSept. 12 - Dec. 30, 2025\n\n## Silver in the Golden Age of Annapolis\n\n[ Explore the Exhibit __](/web/20260115060502/https://hammondharwoodhouse.org/exhibition/silver-in-the-golden-age-of-annapolis/)\n\nPermanent Exhibition\n\n## Slave...",
