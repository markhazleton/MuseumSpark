  "hours_text": "# Campus Tours \n\n## Step Onto Campus, Step Into Your Future\n\nEvery year, thousands of Coyotes achieve their goals at Cal State San Bernardino—and for many, it all starts with a campus visit. Touring CSUSB gives you the chance to picture yourself here, explore our classrooms and labs, and experience the supportive community that will help you define your future.\n\nAt CSUSB, you’ll discover a university that’s affordable, welcoming, and dedicated to preparing you for life and career success.\n\n## Schedule a Campus Tour\n\nThere’s no better way to picture your future than by experiencing CSUSB firsthand. Join us for an in-person or virtual tour of our welcoming, diverse campus community. Each tour is led by a Coyote Ambassador—a current student who will share their own experiences with academics, campus life, and what it’s really like to be part of the Pack.\n\n[ In-Person Tours  ](https://csusb.event451.sites.451.io/event/798864)\n\n[ Group Tours  ](https://csusb.event451.sites.451.io/event/800141)\n\n### Discover CSUSB – Virtual Tours\n\nCan’t make it in person? No problem. Take a 360-degree virtual tour to explore various colleges, the Student Recreation and Wellness Center, Coyote Commons, Pfau Library, the Santos Manuel Student Union, and the Murillo Family Observatory, among other stops. \n\n[Launch Experience](https://www.youvisit.com/#/vte/?data-platform=v&data-link-type=immersive&data-inst=60140&data-image-width=100%&data-image-height=100%&)\n\n### Housing and Palm Desert Campus Tours\n...",
