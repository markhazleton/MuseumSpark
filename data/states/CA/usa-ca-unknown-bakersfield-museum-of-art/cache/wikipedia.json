  "extract": "Downtown is the central business district for Bakersfield, California. It contains several of the city's major theaters, sports complex, museums, and historical landmarks. What is considered to be \"downtown\" Bakersfield varies. Starting from the north and traveling clockwise, Central Bakersfield is bound by the Kern River, Union Avenue, State Route 58, and State Route 99. The Downtown Business Association defines downtown Bakersfield as the region bordered by 24th Street (SR 178), Union Avenue (SR 204), California Avenue, and F Street. Other people extend the boundaries west to State Route 99 and north to Golden State Avenue (SR 204). There are a few tall buildings in Downtown Bakersfield, such as the Bank of America Building (10 stories), the Bakersfield Marriott Hotel (9 stories), and The Padre Hotel (8 stories). The shops and cafes that line the Downtown streets feature dining and shopping venues. Notable attractions in Downtown Bakersfield include the Rabobank Arena, the McMurtrey Aquatic Center, the Bakersfield Museum of Art, the historic Fox Theater, the Padre Hotel, and a nightlife district centered on 19th Street and Wall Street Alley.",
