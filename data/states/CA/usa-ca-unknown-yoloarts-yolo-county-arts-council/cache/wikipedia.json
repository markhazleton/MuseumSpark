  "extract": "Woodland is a city in and the county seat of Yolo County, California, United States. Located approximately 15 miles (24 km) northwest of Sacramento, it is a part of the Sacramento metropolitan area. The population continues to grow every year, with a growth rate of 0.33% annually, and a current population of 61,873. Woodland's origins date to 1850 when California gained statehood and Yolo County was established. The area was well irrigated due to the efforts of James Moore, which drew people into farming as the soil was very fertile. The city gained a federal post office in 1861 with the help of Missourian Frank S. Freeman. A year after this, in 1862, the county seat was moved from Washington (present day West Sacramento) to Woodland after Washington was flooded. The addition of a railroad line to Sacramento, and the more recent addition of Interstate 5, helped the city to thrive.",
