  "collections_text": "# Dana Adobe\n\n;\n\n# Welcome to Dana Adobe\n\nThe Dana Adobe at Rancho Nipomo provides a step back in time to early California. Originally part of the lands of the Chumash, Rancho Nipomo became a Mexican Land Grant given to Captain William Goodwin Dana in 1837. Initially Rancho Nipomo was more than 48,000 acres. Today the Dana Adobe and the surrounding property provides visitors with a deeper understanding of California’s history. The family’s residence, the Dana Adobe, was built in 1839 and is open for guided tours. The Historic Park includes a Mission Grape vineyard, original Tallow Vat, small gardens, miles of hiking trails, museum and much more.\n\n[EXPERIENCE](https://www.danaadobe.org/visit/)\n\n[CELEBRATE](https://www.danaadobe.org/events-2/)\n\n[SUPPORT](https://www.danaadobe.org/give/#give_membership/)",
