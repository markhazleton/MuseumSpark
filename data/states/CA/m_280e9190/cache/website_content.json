While on the faculty of the Pacific School of Religion, Doug founded the Center for the Arts, Religion, and Education, or CARE (now known as the GTU’s Center for the Arts & Religion), as an independent non-profit organization. His intent was to inspire the integration of the arts into worship, and to enliven and enrich religious services and studies with dance, performance, humor, and the visual arts. The 36 years since CARE’s founding have brought many changes, but the organization continues to thrive thanks to the strong foundation Doug established.\n\nFor the inaugural exhibition in the new Doug Adams Gallery, we are pleased to honor our founder, Doug Adams (1945-2007).
