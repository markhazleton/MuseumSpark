Our collections — shaped by these climates from California and the Southern Hemisphere — aren’t just beautiful; they demonstrate extraordinary biodiversity and strategies for surviving dry summers and drought, while providing rich opportunities for research and conservation, and serving an urgent role as public models for water-wise landscapes.\n\n## Discover The Arboretum\n\n[**Get Involved**](https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/get-involved/)\n\n[**What’s Happening**](https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/visit/events/)\n\n[**Gift & Garden Shop**](https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/garden-shop/)\n\n* * *\n\n## Quick Links\n\n[**Pay Garden Admission**](https://shopucscarboretum.com/collections/garden-admission)\n\n[**Join or Renew Membership**](https://www.givecampus.com/campaigns/45464/donations/new?)\n\n[**Volunteer Login**](https://www.volgistics.com/vicnet/226188/login)\n\n[**Rent Our Meeting Hall**](https://arboretum.ucsc.edu/rentals/)\n\n[**Subscribe to Newsletter**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLkG...",
