It celebrates San Francisco’s vast queer past through dynamic and surprising exhibitions and programming. \n\nOpen since January 2011, the museum showcases the sheer depth and breadth of the GLBT Historical Society’s archives, demonstrates the importance of queer history to the public, and mounts wide-ranging exhibitions with an emphasis on diversity and social justice. \n\nIn addition to our long-term exhibition “[Queer Past Becomes Present,](/queer-past-becomes-present)” we host a variety of temporary shows.
