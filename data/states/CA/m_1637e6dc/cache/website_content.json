Established in 1873 by Samuel Knight, this extraordinary facility includes the unique historic equipment and machinery, still in place in its original context, just as it was during its Gold Rush-era heyday.\n\nKnight Foundry is nationally recognized as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark and a California Registered Historical Landmark. The Foundry is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was named by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of America’s eleven most endangered historic places.\n\n**Amador’s Heritage**  \nAs a part of Amador County’s industrial heritage corridor, the Knight Foundry will join the Kennedy Mine, Kennedy Tailing Wheels, Central Eureka Mine, and Miners’ Bend Park to tell the story of how local industry created, and then contributed to, the viability of the Mother Lode communities of Sutter Creek, Amador City, Jackson, and others. The Foundry will serve as an educational resource that provides a unique window into Amador’s history and heritage.\n\n[__Check out the new Knight Foundry Archives](https://hub.catalogit.app/knight-foundry-archives)\n\n __\n\n## **[Click here to...",
