March Field, one of the oldest military airfields in the United States, was originally founded as Alessandro Field in 1918 as one of 32 Air Service training camps following the United States’ entry into WWI. Visitors can experience the full evolution of flight through an impressive collection of over 115 aircraft, spanning more than 120 years of aviation history. From early pioneers of powered flight to iconic World War II bombers and cutting-edge drones, the museum provides a comprehensive look at the advancements in aviation. With something for everyone, March Field Air Museum is a must-visit destination for aviation enthusiasts and families alike.",
