  "extract": "The Walt Disney Family Museum (WDFM) is an American museum that features the life and legacy of Walt Disney. The museum is located in The Presidio of San Francisco, part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco. The museum retrofitted and expanded three existing historic buildings on the Presidio's Main Post. The principal building, at 104 Montgomery Street, faces the Parade Ground, and opened on October 1, 2009. Additional museum offices, the offices of the Walt Disney Family Foundation, and rotating major exhibitions are housed in the Diane Disney Miller Exhibition Hall at 122 Riley Avenue. The Walt Disney Family Museum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was formally owned, operated and funded by the Walt Disney Family Foundation, a non-profit organization established by Disney's heirs including Diane Disney Miller, Disney's daughter and founder of the museum. The museum is not formally associated with and is entirely independent of The Walt Disney Company, the media and entertainment conglomerate. However, the museum has often cooperated with various company units to either borrow various items in the company's custody or to create authorized reproductions of such items to put on display—including the Walt Disney Archives, Walt Disney Animation Studios' Animation Research Library, and Walt Disney Imagineering.",
