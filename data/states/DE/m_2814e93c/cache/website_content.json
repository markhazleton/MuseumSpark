  "hours_text": "## WELCOME TO HAGLEY MUSEUM AND LIBRARY!\n\nHagley is the former industrial site of the original black powder works of the DuPont Company, founded in Delaware in 1802 and powered by the natural resources that surrounded it. Today it is 235 acres of wooded rolling hills along the rushing Brandywine River dotted with hundreds of stone remnants of the black powder industry, dozens of restored buildings associated with the business, and the original ancestral home and gardens of the du Pont family in America. Here, for more than two hundred years, the DuPont Company and family experimented, innovated, and pursued the American dream.\n\n## WHAT TO SEE AND DO\n\n• **Enjoy a fascinating history of the Brandywine Valley** and the various industries that made it an industrial powerhouse of the nineteenth century. Learn about the du Pont family, starting with their journey to America and continuing through the beginning of the DuPont company.\n\n• **Marvel at massive historic stone structures** that housed the powder manufacturing process, working nineteenth-century machinery, a waterwheel, and turbines powered by the river.\n\n• **Enjoy live demonstrations** of a roll mill with two eight-ton roll wheels, a working nineteenth-century machine shop, a coal-fired steam engine, and the blast of gunpowder testing.\n\n• **See and hear water power in action** as the Brandywine River rushes through sluice gates and turbines, providing power to the Birkenhead waterwheel, machine shop, and roll mill. \n\n• **...",
