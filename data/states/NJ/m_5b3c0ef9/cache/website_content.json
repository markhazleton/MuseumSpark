Chhange's archives are now in the process of being digitized, making our collections easily accessible to educators and students from inside their classrooms. Through these meaningful interactions with historical objects, students will learn to connect the past to the present--and use their knowledge to ensure that history does not repeat itself.\n\nChhange has received donations of archival material from 200+ individuals. Materials held include artifacts, artwork, books, correspondence, diaries, clothing, memoirs, oral histories, photographs, and personal and government documents. Holocaust survivors, survivors of the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda, and the families of Armenian Genocide survivors have entrusted Chhange with the care and safekeeping of these valuables because they recognize that these archival items continue to teach their history in our community - long after they can do it themselves. These archival items remain in our community, so our children and tomorrow’s children will be able to bear witness to their history.\n\nChhange:\n\n  * Preserves these historically valuable items\n  * Ensures these materials are stored, handled, and displayed appropriately\n  * Makes them accessible to qualified researchers, scholars and historians\n  ...",
