  "extract": "This list of museums in Mississippi encompasses museums which are defined for this context as institutions (including nonprofit organizations, government entities, and private businesses) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., virtual museums) are not included. Mississippi has a relatively large number of museums focused on Blues music (noted under \"Music\" in the type column of the table below). The \"Regions\" column in the table refers to regional areas with boundaries used by the Mississippi Convention and Visitors Bureau (but with neutral names), as described in the \"Regions\" section below.",
