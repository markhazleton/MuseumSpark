Its location as a transportation hub where Highways 61 and 49 connect, where the Illinois Central and other railroads maintained depots and passenger terminals, and where the Greyhound Bus Company built a station made Clarksdale an economic boom town. Flush times created audiences with money to spend for entertainment, and the blues flourished in the city. Many now-legendary musical artists were born and raised in and around Clarksdale: Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Son House, Ike Turner, Jackie Brenston, Sam Cooke, Junior Parker, and W. C. Handy, among them. Clarksdale was a major market for the Delta's constantly traveling musicians, and the likes of Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf, and Charley Patton are also associated with the city....",

  "collections_text": "# The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker\n\n\"John Lee Hooker's debut on Riverside Records is perhaps the truest to his Mississippi roots. Unaccompanied and playing acoustically instead of his usual amplified guitar, he turned in a wonderfully varied set of deep Delta blues, moans, boogies, one field holler, and even a bit of hokum. Some songs are autobiographical, others reworkings of blues standards-all stamped with the hauntingly personal Hooker touch. The audio for this 60th anniversary release is sourced from the original stereo tapes that were mastered on all analog by Kevin Gray at Coherent Audio. It was pressed on 180-gram vinyl at Memphis Record Pressing.\" - _John Lee Hooker Estate_ __[Available in the Gift Shop](https://www.deltabluesmuseum.org/cart2/)\n\n* * *\n\n# DBM's 78s Record Collection\n\nSince our founding in 1979, the Delta Blues Museum has generously been given donations of thousands of 78s in every conceivable genre.
