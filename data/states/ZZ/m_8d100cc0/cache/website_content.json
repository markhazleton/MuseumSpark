The joy in the eyes of a toddler is equally inspiring to us as the trained and knowledgeable eye of a veteran experiencing the treasures of The Hangar Flight Museum for the first time. We recommend you plan at least an hour to explore the Museum, though you could certainly spend longer to delve deeper into the stories of the men and women who made Canadian aviation what it is today. \n\n## UPCOMING EVENTS\n\nSee what's up at The Hangar and check out the [Upcoming Events page](/upcoming-events) for more info. \n\n> It's a great collection of aircraft reflecting the growth of aviation in Canada.

Located in a drill hall that was built as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan during the Second World War, this Calgary attraction is a hidden gem and a must-see destination. We are passionate about bringing aviation history to life and trust that a visit to our museum will leave you inspired with dreams of flight! Looking to get a tour inside one of our aircraft? We offer this experience during the summer on weekends - June 2026 will begin the next season. We are currently completing phased truss strengthening to protect the wooden beams of our historic building's roof system. This construction work means our elevator to reach our mezzanine level is currently not in use. \n\n## Inspiring Dreams of Flight\n\n____\n\n____\n\n[ LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ](/land-acknowledgement)\n\n[ HOME OF CANADA'S AVIATION HALL OF FAME ](https://cahf.ca/)\n\n[ BIRTHDAY PARTIES ](/kids-birthday-parties)\n\n[ RENT OUR FACILITY ](/rent-our-facility)\n\n[ FISE: UNITED SPACE SCHOOL ](/united-space-school)\n\n[ EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES ](/hangar-home)\n\n[ SEE WHAT'S UP AT THE HANGAR ](/media)\n\n[ BOO...",
