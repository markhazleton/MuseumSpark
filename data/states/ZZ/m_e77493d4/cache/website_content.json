The plans you make now can help the Centre thrive in the future!\n\nA bequest – a provision in your will or estate plan designating assets to the Centre – doesn’t impact your finances today and will make a world of difference in generations to come. Make a gift without affecting your financial security. You may even be able to make a larger donation than otherwise possible.\n\nOr consider donating a life insurance policy to Confederation Centre of the Arts. A donated life insurance policy isn’t subject to taxes, probate costs, or estate debts, and you can make a substantial contribution through relatively small monthly or yearly payments.\n\n**Talk to your financial advisor today about planned giving!**\n\n## Learn more about Planned Giving\n\nContact **Emily Smith** , Major Gifts Officer  \n[902-629-1169](902-629-1178) or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5237213f3b263a12313d3c343736372033263b3d3c31373c2620377c313d3f)",
