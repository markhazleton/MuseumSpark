  "extract": "Saskatoon () is the largest city in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It straddles a bend in the South Saskatchewan River in the central region of the province. It is located along the Trans-Canada Yellowhead Highway; since its founding in 1882 as a Temperance colony, it has served as the cultural and economic hub of central Saskatchewan. With a 2021 census population of 266,141, Saskatoon is the largest city in Saskatchewan, and the 17th largest Census Metropolitan Area in Canada, with a 2021 census population of 317,480. Saskatoon is home to the University of Saskatchewan, the Meewasin Valley Authority—which protects the South Saskatchewan River and provides for the city's popular riverbank park spaces—and Wanuskewin Heritage Park, a National Historic Site of Canada and UNESCO World Heritage applicant representing 6,000 years of First Nations history. The Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344, the most populous rural municipality in Saskatchewan, surrounds the city and contains many of the developments associated with it, including Wanuskewin. Saskatoon is named after the saskatoon berry, which is native to the region and is itself derived from the Cree misâskwatômina. The city has a significant Indigenous population and several urban Reserves. The city has nine river crossings and is nicknamed the \"Paris of the Prairies\" and \"The City of Bridges\". Historic neighbourhoods of Saskatoon include Nutana, Riversdale, and Sutherland which were separate towns before amalgamating with the town of Saskatoon and incorporating it as a city in 1906. Nutana, Riversdale, their historic main streets of Broadway Avenue and 20th Street, as well as the downtown core and other central neighbourhoods are seeing significant reinvestment and redevelopment. Sutherland was a rail town beyond the University of Saskatchewan lands, annexed by the city in 1956.",
