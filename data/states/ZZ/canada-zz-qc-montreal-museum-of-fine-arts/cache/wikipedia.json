The museum is located on the historic Golden Square Mile stretch of Sherbrooke Street West. The MMFA is spread across five pavilions, and occupies a total floor area of 53,095 square metres (571,510 sq ft), 13,000 (140,000 sq ft) of which are exhibition space. With the 2016 inauguration of the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace, the museum campus was expected to become the eighteenth largest art museum in North America. The permanent collection included approximately 44,000 works in 2013. The original \"reading room\" of the Art Association of Montreal was the precursor of the museum's current library, the oldest art library in Canada. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is a member of the International Group of Organizers of Large-scale Exhibitions, also known as the Bizot Group, a forum which allows the leaders of the largest museums in the world to exchange works and exhibitions. Founded in 1860, it is the oldest art museum in Canada. In 2020, it was the most visited art museum in Canada.",
