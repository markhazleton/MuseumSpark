  "hours_text": "# Planning Division\n\nSection Menu\n\n## Welcome to the Planning Division at the Town of Grimsby.\n\nA planning department's primary role in a municipality is to manage land use, guide development, and ensure a community's growth aligns with its vision and goals. It helps guide how a community grows and develops and works with residents, businesses, and local leaders to make decisions about land use, zoning, new developments, and community improvements.\n\nTown planning is driven by input from various community stakeholders. This includes the public, developers, Town Council, and several standing committees. The volume and type of applications are divided amongst staff including development, policy, permits, and compliance. \n\nAn application or permit received by the staff is often required to go through various tests to ensure its suitability for the Town. Guided by the Official Plan, the process can include elements of public consultation, site visits, committee meetings and Council approval.\n\nIn essence, a planning department acts as a facilitator and regulator, guiding development in a way that balances the needs of residents, businesses, and the environment. \n\nWhether it's shaping neighbourhoods, preserving green spaces, or planning for future transportation needs, the planning department plays a key role in creating safe, vibrant, and well-organized places to live and work.\n\nTo send a general inquiry to the Planning Department, please contact: [planning@grimsby.ca](mailto:plann...",
