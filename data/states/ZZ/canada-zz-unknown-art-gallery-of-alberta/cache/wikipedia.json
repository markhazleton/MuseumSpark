  "extract": "The Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA) is an art museum in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The museum occupies an 8,000 square metres (86,000 sq ft) building at Churchill Square in downtown Edmonton. The museum building was originally designed by Donald G. Bittorf, and B. James Wensley, although portions of that structure were demolished or built over during a redevelopment of the building by Randall Stout. The art museum was established in 1924 as the Edmonton Museum of Arts. In 1956, the museum was renamed the Edmonton Art Gallery. The museum occupied a number of locations in the years after its establishment in 1924 until 1969. That year, the museum relocated to its present location and was reopened to the public in the Brutalist Arthur Blow Condell building. In 2005, the museum was renamed Art Gallery of Alberta. From 2007 to 2010, the building underwent an CA$88 million redevelopment, and was reopened to the public on January 31, 2010. Its collection includes over 6,000 works, with a focus on art produced in Alberta, and other parts of western Canada. In addition to exhibiting its permanent collection, the museum also hosts travelling exhibitions and offers public education programs.",
