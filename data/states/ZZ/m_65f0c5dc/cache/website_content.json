  "accessibility_text": "The deposit copy of Martha Langford’s long awaited book, _A History of Photography in Canada [Volume I – Anticipation to Participation]_ (McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2025) has just been received by the New Brunswick Museum’s Research Library.\n\nThe volume chronicles the reports of this new visual art form’s invention to its widespread adoption in Canada.

Eight photographs from the New Brunswick Museum help to tell the story.",
