  "hours_text": "> **Leave a lasting legacy that celebrates your passion for the arts and culture. Your planned gift is an investment in clay, glass, and enamel artists and will support the Canadian Clay & Glass Gallery for generations to come.**\n\nLeaving a gift is easy and rewarding. There are many ways to do it, including by testamentary bequest, life insurance designation, or the creation of or contribution toward an endowment fund. We ask that you consult your financial advisor to determine the right planned giving option for you. We invite you to email us at [director@theclayandglass.ca](mailto:director@theclayandglass.ca) or call Sarah Stanners, Executive Director directly at 519-746-1882 x231 to discuss more.\n\n### Charitable Will Bequests\n\nYou can make a gift by will, referred to as a bequest, for a specific sum, or for a share or percentage of your estate. Leaving a bequest in your will allows you to make a charitable donation once your needs and those of your loved ones have been met. Providing a gift to the Canadian Clay & Glass Gallery in your will is also a great way to invest in the future of Canadian artists, make a lasting difference for years to come, and to potentially reduce the taxes owed by your estate. The designated amount can be directed toward the Gallery’s general needs or to a specific cause that matters to you. \n\nFor bequest purposes, our legal name is the “Canadian Clay & Glass Gallery” and our charitable registration number is 11883 0256 RR0001.
