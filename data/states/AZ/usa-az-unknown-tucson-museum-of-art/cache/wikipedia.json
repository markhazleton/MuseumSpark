  "extract": "Tucson International Airport (IATA: TUS, ICAO: KTUS, FAA LID: TUS) is a civil-military airport owned by the City of Tucson 8 miles (7.0 nmi; 13 km) south of downtown Tucson, in Pima County, Arizona, United States. It is the second busiest airport in Arizona, after Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2025–2029 categorized it as a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings per year and as a small hub since it receives between 0.05% and 0.25% of annual U.S. commercial enplanements (0.2% of 2023 U.S. commercial enplanements to be more precise). Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 1,959,789 enplanements in 2024, an increase from 1,925,546 in 2023. Tucson International is operated on a long-term lease by the Tucson Airport Authority, which also operates Ryan Airfield, a general aviation airport. Public transportation to the airport is Sun Tran bus routes No. 11 and No. 25.",
