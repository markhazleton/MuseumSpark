It is located in Bowling Green, Kentucky, off Interstate 65's Exit 28 and near the General Motors' Bowling Green Assembly Plant, where Corvettes are solely manufactured. It was constructed in 1994. It was opened to the public in September of that year. In October 2025, the museum announced a major expansion with an additional 66,000-square-feet of space to grow its Corvette collection, scheduled to open in late 2026. The museum was recently gifted a 1967 Corvette Sting Ray, once owned by the first man on the moon, astronaut Neil Armstrong.",
