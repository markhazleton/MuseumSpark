  "extract": "The Frazier History Museum, previously known as the Frazier Historical Arms Museum and the Frazier International History Museum, is a Kentucky history museum located on Museum Row in the West Main District of downtown Louisville, Kentucky. Founded in 2004 as a museum of historical arms and armor, the Frazier has since expanded its focus. An affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, the museum preserves and presents Kentucky history through artifacts, exhibitions, educational programs, Bourbon tastings, and guided tours. Subjects of permanent exhibitions include Kentucky history, Kentucky pop culture, Kentucky bourbon whiskey, the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and the Stewart Historic Miniatures Collection. The museum is a non-profit organization funded by private donations. In 2018, the Frazier became the official starting point of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.",
