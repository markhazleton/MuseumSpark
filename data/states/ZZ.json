It’s not huge, but it punches above its weight with rotating exhibitions that often spotlight local and emerging artists. The vibe is welcoming, and the staff are genuinely passionate about art. I liked how they mix contemporary pieces with community-driven projects—makes it feel grounded and relevant.\nOn the flip side, the gallery’s size means you’ll probably finish your visit in under an hour unless you join a workshop or event. Also, parking downtown can be a bit tricky during busy hours.\nStill, it’s a solid stop if you’re exploring Vernon and want a dose of creativity. Pair it with a walk through Polson Park or a coffee nearby for a fuller experience.",

Positives: four focused gallery spaces with roughly 15–20 rotating exhibitions a year and strong community programming, relaxed admission-by-donation policy that makes it easy to drop in, and public events that actually draw locals rather than just tourists. Negatives: the footprint is modest so big installations can feel crowded, touring shows sometimes dominate over local artists, and weekend visits can be busy during openings which makes the quiet gallery vibe harder to find. Great for a thoughtful hour of contemporary and regional work without the pressure of a big museum.",
