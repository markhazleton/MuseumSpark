All of the paintings had “deep meaning” behind them but in the end not that deep because they only represented modern politically correct ideas and nothing else. There was nothing in there that made me truly reflective or change my perspective.\n\nIt was all art that was made poorly. It was appreciated because the “intentional” mistakes and inconsistencies in the art were supposed to represent something deeper. However art is naturally incosistent and imperfect. When that becomes the focus of the artwork we move away from art and more towards empty political statements. Art needs to be first and foremost beautiful and difficult to replicate or match. There needs to be at the very base a deep appreciation for the creative process. Art is not only about statements it’s about testing the limits of the human creative spirit and its capacity to create paradise.",

Its reputation is local, but the experience is serious—ideal for travelers who enjoy seeing how a region tells its story through art. NEHMA’s strengths center on **American art of the 20th and 21st centuries**, with particular resonance for the American West and the cultural landscapes of Utah and the Intermountain region. Expect galleries that encourage comparison between *abstraction* and *representation*, and between studio-driven experimentation and place-based imagery.\n\nArchitecturally, NEHMA’s campus setting contributes to the visit: you’ll move through **quiet, light-conscious gallery spaces** designed for viewing rather than spectacle, with a rhythm that makes it easy to dip in for an hour or linger longer. Rotating exhibitions keep repeat visits worthwhile, often pairing collection works with contemporary perspectives—an engaging way to track living conversations in art.\n\nFor visitors, the pleasure is in the museum’s **approachability and clarity**: readable wall texts, manageable scale, and the sense that you’re seeing works chosen with intention. Pair your visit with a stroll through USU’s grounds and nearby Logan cafés; NEHMA fits beautifully into a day trip, offering a concentrated encounter with modern and contemporary art in a setting that feels both scholarly and welcoming.",
