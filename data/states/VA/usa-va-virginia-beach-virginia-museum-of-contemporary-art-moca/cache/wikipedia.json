  "extract": "The Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art, marketed as Virginia MOCA, is a non-collecting contemporary art museum and community art center in Virginia Beach, Virginia, widely known for its annual Boardwalk Art Show. Virginia MOCA itself evolved from a succession of local art associations: the Virginia Beach Art Association (VBAA, 1952–1971), the Virginia Beach Art Center (1971–1989) and the Virginia Contemporary Art Center (1989–2010). Virginia MOCA is located just off the Virginia Beach oceanfront. In July of 2023, Virginia MOCA said it would move to a new facility to be constructed at the Virginia Beach campus of Virginia Wesleyan University.",
