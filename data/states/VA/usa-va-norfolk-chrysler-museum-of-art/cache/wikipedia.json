  "extract": "The Chrysler Museum of Art is an art museum on the border between downtown and the Ghent district of Norfolk, Virginia. The museum was founded in 1933 as the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences. In 1971, automotive heir Walter P. Chrysler Jr. (whose wife, Jean Outland Chrysler, was a native of Norfolk) donated most of his extensive collection to the museum. This single gift significantly expanded the museum's collection, making it one of the major art museums in the Southeastern United States. The museum has a collection of more than 35,000 objects, including one the largest glass collections in America. Its holdings range from media including paintings, sculpture, photography, and decorative arts. The Museum's campus also features the Perry Glass Studio, a full-service restaurant, a gift shop, Kaufman Theater, and the Goode Works on Paper Center, and it oversees the historic Myers House.",
