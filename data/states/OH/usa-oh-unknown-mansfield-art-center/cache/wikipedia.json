  "extract": "Mansfield is a city in Richland County, Ohio, United States, and its county seat. The population was 47,534 at the 2020 census. Located approximately halfway between Cleveland and Columbus via Interstate 71, it is part of Northeast Ohio region in the western foothills of the Allegheny Plateau. The city was founded in 1808 on a fork of the Mohican River in a hilly region surrounded by fertile farmlands, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location with numerous railroad lines. After the decline of heavy industry, the city's economy has since diversified into a service economy, including retailing, education, and healthcare sectors. The city anchors the Mansfield Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 124,936 residents in 2020, while the Mansfield–Ashland–Bucyrus, OH Combined Statistical Area had 219,408 residents. Mansfield is the largest city in the Mid-Ohio region. Its official nickname is \"The Fun Center of Ohio\"; Mansfield is also known as the \"Carousel Capital of Ohio.\"",
