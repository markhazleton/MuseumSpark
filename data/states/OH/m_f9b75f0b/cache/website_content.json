  "accessibility_text": "# ACCESSIBILITY\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe goal of The Butler Institute of American Art is to provide high quality experiences for visitors, docents, and employees of all ages and capabilities. This plan, therefore, outlines measures to ensure the best possible access to the museum’s exhibits and programs, as well as public spaces, in a manner that promotes dignity, independence, integration, and equal opportunity.\n\nThis plan is based on our commitment at The Butler Institute of American Art to human rights and living the fundamental principle that we are all born free and equal in dignity and rights. Our obligations under Title III of the ADA (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability by public accommodations and requiring places of public accommodation and commercial facilities to be designed, constructed, as well as altered in compliance with the ADA accessibility standards) provide a framework to identify and eliminate barriers to accessibility so we can prevent and actively address discrimination against persons with disabilities.\n\nThis plan captures accessibility at the Butler today and our way forward: work we have done, work we are doing, and work we intend to do. We will continue to strive to make our programs as accessible as possible to everyone in the future.\n\n## Service Animals\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as any breed of dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual wi...",
