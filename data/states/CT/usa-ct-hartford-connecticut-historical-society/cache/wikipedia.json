  "extract": "This list of museums in Connecticut contains museums which are defined for this context as institutions (including nonprofit organizations, government entities, and private businesses) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Non-profit and university art galleries are also included. Museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., virtual museums) are not included. Inclusion in this list is generally for institutions with the name \"museum\" in the title. Some other institutions not included here are very like museums, and some \"museums\" here don't fit the typical definition of a place that shows exhibits. The Lockwood–Mathews Mansion Museum, for instance, is a historic mansion in which the \"exhibit\" is essentially the building itself. For Wikipedia links to institutions similar to museums in Connecticut, consult the \"See also\" section.",
