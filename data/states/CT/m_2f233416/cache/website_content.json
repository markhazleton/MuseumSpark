  "accessibility_text": "#### **Accessibility**\n\nBecause the Stowe Center is comprised of 19th century landscape and buildings, some ADA adjustments require advance arrangements for the best experience for your group. Please indicate if we can provide accommodations and services in advance by calling 860.522.9258, or send an email to [tickets@stowecenter.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20250519184929/mailto:tickets@stowecenter.org)\n\nThe **first floor** of the Visitor Center (which includes the ticketing desk and museum store) is wheelchair accessible, but restrooms are only accessible via stairs to a lower level.\n\nThe **first floor** of the Stowe House is accessible to non-electric wheelchairs. A portable ramp allows visitors to bypass the porch steps to access the building. The house tour itself includes one flight of stairs, and so the second story of the home is not accessible to wheelchair users. For folks unable to use stairs, we offer an alternative tour that provides digital images and information about the upper floor, provided by a staff member.\n\nThe Stowe Center is undertaking a major renovation to our grounds and Visitor Center that will vastly improve the accessibility of our campus.\n\n#### **General Information**\n\nLarge backpacks, gum, food, and beverages are not permitted in the Stowe House. Visitors are welcome to picnic on the grounds.\n\n#### PHOTO POLICY\n\n  * No flash photography is allowed in the Stowe House.\n  * No videos are allowed to be taken inside the Stowe House.\n  * All images...",

The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. \n\nHistory is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were \"resolved\" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there.
