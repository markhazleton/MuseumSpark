  "extract": "The Keeler Tavern is an 18th-century historical building at 152 Main Street in the center of Ridgefield, Connecticut, United States. The property served as summer home to architect Cass Gilbert, who purchased it in 1907 and designed additions to the building as well as a garden. It is also significant for the part it played in the Battle of Ridgefield when British forces passed through, in 1777. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and is operated as the Keeler Tavern Museum & History Center (KTM&HC). It is also included in the Ridgefield Center Historic District, NRHP-listed in 1984.",
