First, following two guests, you enter the main museum space through the underground parking garage elevator. Then, a different guest who rode their bike to the museum exits the Oak Leaf Trail to enter the museum on the East End. Finally, different sets of guests experience the galleries and campus amenities together—viewing and discussing the art on display, playing on the East Lawn, reading a book in reflection spaces, and eating at the Café. \n\n#  Visit\n\nOpen today 10 A.M.—5 P.M.\n\nOpen today 10 A.M.—5 P.M.",
