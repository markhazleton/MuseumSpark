  "extract": "The Patrick and Beatrice Haggerty Museum of Art, also referred to as the Haggerty Museum of Art or The Haggerty, is an art museum located on the campus of Marquette University in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The museum opened on November 11, 1984, following a collaborative effort chaired by professor Curtis L. Carter. As of 2025, its collection comprises about 10,000 works, a selection of which is on view on two levels of exhibition spaces totaling 5,246 sq. ft. (487 m2). Construction was made possible by a donation from alumnus and co-founder of Texas Instruments, Inc. Patrick E. Haggerty (1914–1980) and his wife Beatrice (1913–2003), for whom the museum is named. The building was originally designed by San Antonio architect O'Neil Ford. After Ford's death, the project was taken over by Milwaukee architect David Kahler. American artist and social activist Keith Haring created a mural called Construction Fence, inspired by breakdancing, for the fence surrounding the building's construction site. The work was later relocated inside the galleries.",
