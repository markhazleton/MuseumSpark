Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Statement Summary\n\n###### Photography: RAM Staff\n\nRacine Art Museum Association, Inc. (RAMA) is committed to supporting diverse artists, voices, and audiences—whether that diversity reflects race, gender, heritage, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, social standing, or world perspective.\n\nAs a cultural/educational institution rooted in the humanities and using art as a catalyst, RAMA wants to encourage inquiry, exploration, and empathy about the world in which we live. RAM and Wustum Museum strive to provide spaces and experiences that show art is powerful—it can offer new viewpoints, moments of wonder, flights of the imagination, difficult or fantastical things to ponder, an occasion to relax or reflect, and also, significantly, a means to understand or connect and interact. Additionally, because every culture has historically excelled in making functional, decorative, or religious objects by hand, craft in particular can form links between people of diverse backgrounds.\n\nWith this in mind, RAMA is moving forward with continued empathy and kindness. To make positive societal change and advancement possible, we believe exposure to a broad range of visual art and cultural education programs expands self-expression, creative problem-solving, more open communication, spiritual nourishment, and increased empathy.
