  "extract": "The Milwaukee Art Museum (also referred to as MAM) is an art museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Its collection of nearly 35,000 works of art and gallery spaces totaling 150,000 sq. ft. (13,900 m²) make it the largest art museum in the state of Wisconsin and one of the largest art museums in the United States. The Milwaukee Art Museum emerged from the reunion of two prior art institutions, the Layton Art Gallery and the Milwaukee Art Institute, both established in 1888. In 1957, they combined their collections inside the newly-completed Milwaukee County War Memorial designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, forming the Milwaukee Arts Center (renamed Milwaukee Art Museum in 1980). Subsequent expansions included the David Kahler Building in 1975, the Quadracci Pavilion by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, inaugurated in 2001, and the East End entrance, opened in 2015. Among highlights of the collection are paintings by American artists of the Ashcan School, American and European decorative arts, 19th-century German art and early-20th-century German Expressionist art, as well as folk and Haitian art. The museum also holds one of the largest collections of works by Wisconsin-born artist Georgia O'Keeffe in the United States. In 2024, the Milwaukee Art Museum was ranked 8th best art museum in the country by the readers and editors of USA Today, one of the biggest US newspapers by number of subscribers and print circulation.",
