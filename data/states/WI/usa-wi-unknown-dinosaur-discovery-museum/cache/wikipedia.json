  "extract": "The Dinosaur Discovery Museum in Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States, is dedicated to the exploration and explication of the relationship between the theropods, which include early and modern birds and ancient carnivorous biped dinosaurs such as Carnotaurus, Tyrannosaurus rex, and Archaeopteryx. This link is especially well documented in the fossil record. The museum has the largest skeletal cast collection of theropods dinosaurs in North America and is the only museum to focus a gallery specifically on the evolution of birds (avian dinosaurs) from non-avian dinosaurs, with a second smaller gallery focusing on \"Little Clint\", a three-year-old Tyrannosaurus uncovered by a dig conducted with the Carthage Institute of Paleontology. The museum is located in the former post office (later the home of the Kenosha Public Museum building) and is a part of the Kenosha Public Museums system. The museum is unrelated to the Dinosaur Discovery Center in Maine.",
