The discovery of gold in 1875 led to the founding of Deadwood the following year and brought enormous wealth and notoriety to the area. The booming town immediately gained a reputation as a rough-and-tumble mining camp where Wild Bill Hickok was killed and Calamity Jane earned her fame. Eventually, with the arrival of electricity, telephone service, and the railroad, Deadwood grew into a stable and thriving business community.\n\n## OUR PROPERTIES\n\n  * [Adams Museum](https://www.deadwoodhistory.com/abou...",

  "accessibility_text": "#  About W.E. Adams \n\nWhen thinking of legendary people that helped shape Deadwood, one typically conjures an image of Wild Bill, Calamity Jane, or perhaps Seth Bullock. While these personalities are integral to the history of the area, another man arguably created a more tangible, lasting legacy for the city of Deadwood and the surrounding Black Hills. The man was W.E. Adams, the name behind the Adams Museum, the Historic Adams House, and the Homestake Adams Research and Cultural Center. Despite the name having such a dominant presence today, many are left wondering, “Who was W.E. Adams?”\n\nAt the age of 23, William Emery Adams and his older brother, James, came to Deadwood in 1877. Together, the two brothers built and operated a grocery store on Main Street, originally called the Banner Grocery. The fire of 1879 destroyed the building. The brothers soon rebuilt and were back in business again.\n\nW.E. married Alice Burhnam in 1880 and together they had two daughters: Lucile, born 1884 and Helen, born 1892. With a burgeoning business, W.E. was able to provide a happy and comfortable lifestyle for his wife and children. The Adams’ changed residences in Deadwood several times, each time moving into a larger and more elegant home.\n\nIn 1894, W.E. built a new store on Sherman Street that eventually reached four stories and occupied an entire block. The building came to be known as the Adams Block building. Adams focused less on retail and more on wholesale; creating one of the large...",
