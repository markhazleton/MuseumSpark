Fears named it Broken Arrow. The city was named for a community settled by Creek Native Americans who had been forced to relocate from Alabama to Oklahoma along the Trail of Tears. Although Broken Arrow was originally an agricultural community, its current economy is diverse. The city has the third-largest concentration of manufacturers in the state.",
