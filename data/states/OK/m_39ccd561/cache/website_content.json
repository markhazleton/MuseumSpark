Father Gregory Gerrer, for whom the museum is named, was a Benedictine monk of considerable artistic talent. During Father Gerrer’s travels to Europe, Africa, and South America, he collected objects of artistic and ethological value.\n\nThe Museum’s permanent collections include Egyptian, Greek, and Roman objects; art from the Renaissance through the early 20th century; and large holdings of Native American, African, Oceanic, and Eastern cultural artifacts. The Egyptian collection is considered by some to be the finest between Chicago and Los Angeles. In addition, the Museum offers exciting special exhibitions throughout the year.\n\n[ ](http://web.archive.org/web/20260105110038/https://www.mgmoa.org/swan/)\n\n[ ](http://web.archive.org/web/20260105110038/https://www.mgmoa.org/calendar/)\n\n[ ](http://web.archive.org/web/20260105110038/https://www.mgmoa.org/asa-c...",
