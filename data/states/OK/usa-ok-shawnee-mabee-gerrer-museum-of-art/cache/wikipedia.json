  "extract": "The Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art is a non-profit art museum in Shawnee, Oklahoma, USA. It is located on the former Oklahoma Baptist University Green Campus, being the campus of the former St. Gregory's University. In June 2024, over six years since the closing of St. Gregory's University, it was announced that the university land would return to the monks of St. Gregory's Abbey. The museum operated independently of St. Gregory's University and Oklahoma Baptist University and survived the closure and operational changes of the campus grounds. The museum's collection includes over 3,500 artworks, and spans over 8,000 years of art, and represents cultures from around the world including ancient Egyptian, Chinese, pre-Columbian, African, Native American, European, and American art. The museum houses the official portrait of Pope Pius X and Oklahoma's only Egyptian mummies. The museum includes a gift shop that sells educational toys, publications related to their exhibitions and arts and crafts from local artisans. The MGMoA is a member of the Oklahoma Association of Museums and a member agency of Oklahoma City's Allied Arts. From 2009 until 2020, the museum hosted the annual arts festival Arts Trek.",
