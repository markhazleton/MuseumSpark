Woolaroc was established in 1925 as the ranch retreat of oilman Frank Phillips. The ranch is a 3,700-acre (1,500 ha) wildlife preserve, home to over 30 different species of native and exotic wildlife, such as bison, elk and longhorn cattle. Woolaroc is also a museum with a collection of Western art and artifacts, American Indian material, and one of the largest collections of Colt firearms in the world. Also on display is Woolaroc, the aircraft that won the ill-fated Dole Air Race in 1927.
