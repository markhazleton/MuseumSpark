  "extract": "The Mariposa Museum & World Culture Center is a museum in Peterborough, New Hampshire, United States. It was founded in 2002, by husband-and-wife team David Blair and Linda Marsella to improve awareness and understanding across cultural boundaries. The Mariposa was designed as a \"hands-on\" museum and is located in Peterborough's Baptist Church building (1841), which was added to the New Hampshire State Register of Historic Places in 2011. In 2019, the Mariposa expanded its mission and opened the Mariposa Museum in Oak Bluffs in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts to showcase the work and scholarship of African-American artists. The Mariposa Museum in Oak Bluffs is Martha’s Vineyard’s only museum dedicated to African-American artists.",
