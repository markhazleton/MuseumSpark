  "collections_text": "# DISCOVER ENFIELD SHAKER MUSEUM\n\nEnfield Shaker Village is nestled in a lush valley between Shaker Mountain and Mascoma Lake in New Hampshire. This special place has been cherished for over 230 years–first by the Shakers who lived, worked, and worshiped here from 1793 to 1923, and now by Museum staff, donors, members, and visitors from around the world.\n\nThe Shakers believed in equality of the sexes and races, celibacy, communal ownership of property, and separation from the “World’s people”. They opposed war and sought perfection in their work. In their large and architecturally distinct communities the Shakers achieved a remarkable degree of sustainability and self-sufficiency.\n\nWe invite you to visit Enfield Shaker Museum to learn firsthand about the Shakers who lived, worked, and worshiped in this beautiful place.
