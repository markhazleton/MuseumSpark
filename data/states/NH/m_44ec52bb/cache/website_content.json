Originally a museum of folk art, the Mariposa now also explores human experience and culture through a range of media and in a more contemporary context. Exhibits for all ages may examine a region of the world or cultures in transition, multiculturalism in the U.S., or an individual experience, all with an eye to understanding a diverse world and fostering greater compassion, understanding, and peace.\n\nThe Mariposa Museum in Oak Bluffs explores American history and African diaspora experience through the creativity of artists, storytellers, and scholars. The museum is open from June - October! We look forward to welcoming you!",
