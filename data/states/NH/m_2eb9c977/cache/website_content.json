  "hours_text": "# Visit\n\n### Explore New Hampshire’s Past\n\nWe love New Hampshire. And, we’ve been saving its history for nearly two centuries. Nowhere will you find a more extensive collection of objects and archives related to New Hampshire's history.\n\nThe New Hampshire Historical Society’s 1911 headquarters building, located in the heart of the capital city, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is home to exhibitions about New Hampshire history, art, and culture. Exhibitions showcase hundreds of objects, photographs, and documents, including:\n\n  * Native American artifacts;\n  * items from the Revolutionary period through the Civil War and World War II;\n  * the original 1818 eagle that once sat atop the state capitol;\n  * portraits of notable New Hampshire residents including Franklin Pierce and Daniel Webster;\n  * early furniture, silver, and other decorative arts;\n  * 19th-century White Mountain landscape paintings;\n  * and memorabilia from New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primaries.\n\nPeople of all ages visit the New Hampshire Historical Society every day. Many are first-time visitors who come to see the exhibitions. Other visitors come time and time again. They are genealogists, teachers, students, historians, authors, and others with an interest in researching New Hampshire’s history—and their own.\n\n[](https://nhhistory.oncell.com/en/index.html)\n\n## [Audio Tour](http://nhhistory.oncell.com/en/index.html)\n\nEnjoy an [audio tour](https://nhhistory.oncell.com/en/inde...",
