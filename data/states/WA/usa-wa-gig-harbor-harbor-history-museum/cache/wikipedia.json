Gig Harbor bills itself as \"the Maritime City\" and maintains a strong connection to its maritime heritage. Due to its close access to several state and city parks, and historic waterfront that includes boutiques and fine dining, it has become a popular tourist destination. Gig Harbor is located along State Route 16, about 6 mi (9.7 km) from its origin at Interstate 5, over the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.",
