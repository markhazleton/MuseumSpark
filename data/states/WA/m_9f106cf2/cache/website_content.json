The Cowlitz County Historical Museum operates as a partnership between Cowlitz County and the Cowlitz County Historical Society.\n\nFormed in 1949, the Society began operating a museum in a space provided by Cowlitz County in 1953. In 1979, the museum relocated to its current location on Allen Street. Museum staff are a combination of Historical Society and County employees. This public-private partnership has benefited our community by making the Cowlitz County Historical Museum an attraction providing quality exhibits, archival research facilities, and engaging educational and public programming.\n\nMembers take pride in the knowledge that they are the key to the museum’s ongoing mission of collecting, preserving and interpreting our history.\n\n* * *\n\n[Become a Member Today!](https://cowlitzcountyhistory.org/store/)\n\n_**Membership includes:**_\n\n· Subscr...",
