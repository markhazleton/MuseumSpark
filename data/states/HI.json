We were looking for a place where we could spend a bit of time with a 6 month old baby and this was a great choice. We looked at the exhibit, walked the lovely grounds (saw roosters which my son loved), observed the pottery class that was going on, and then bought some unique local art from the gift shop. Staff were friendly and we felt very welcome to relax and explore. It was nice to visit a “locals” spot and not somewhere specifically catered to tourists. The Art Center, combined with Kaya’s Cafe down the road was the perfect laid-back afternoon.",
