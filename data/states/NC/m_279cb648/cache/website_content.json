  "accessibility_text": "Levine Museum of the New South is committed to sharing the stories of historically underrepresented people and cultures and acknowledging and addressing systemic inequities and wrongdoings both internally and externally. Levine Museum is in a unique position to expose injustices in our community, past and present, and to raise awareness of DEIA issues. We value difference and work to remove and reduce emotional, cognitive, physical, and financial barriers to Levine Museum’s offerings. We will commit to fearlessly facing and addressing historical inequities, and we will continue to foster conversation, inspire empathy, and celebrate communities in everything we do.\n\nWe will achieve this by:\n\n  * Listening to each other and allowing our audiences to define their needs.\n  * Recognizing that identities are intersectional and seeking to address biases.\n  * Striving to use language that respectfully describes historically underrepresented people and groups.\n  * Providing a safe space where everyone feels valued and heard without fear of repercussions, while challenging harmful ideas and language.\n  * Fostering an inclusive culture of respect, empathy, belonging, and equity in both our internal commitments and policies, and external communications and experiences.\n  * Participating in ongoing diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and anti-racism training.\n  * Monitoring and measuring our progress.\n  * Seeking improvement through regular review of our organizational policies a...",
