As the only museum in the Southern United States dedicated to European and American modern art and its legacies, the Bechtler is rooted in a remarkable era of art history from the collection of the Zürich-based Bechtler family. Intimate in scale, the signature terra-cotta building, designed by Swiss architect Mario Botta, features three floors of gallery spaces designed to pair the museum’s collection with national and international exhibitions that explore and celebrate the importance of modernism and the art it inspired. Please join us as we explore, as modern artists before us did, the always-changing nature of the world around us.\n\n## HOURS + DIRECTIONS\n\nMonday 10 AM – 5 PM \n\nTuesday CLOSED \n\nWednesday 10 AM – 9 PM*\n\n[*Free Admission Wednesday from 5 – 9 PM.](https://www.bechtler.org/events)\n\nThursday 10 AM – 5 PM   \nFriday 10 AM – 5 PM   \nSaturday 10 AM – 5 PM \n\nSunday Noon – 5 PM \n\nClosed New Year’s Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.\n\nGETTING HERE \n\n​\n\nBechtler Museum of Modern Art\n\nGPS Address: 420 South Tryon\n\n[Click here for Google ma...",
