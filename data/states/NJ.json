All of them help provide an amazing experience. Several members took the time to have conversations, suggestions & were extremely kind & respectful. The one negative I had was I did not meet curator Ryan Szimanski (who worked himself sick from the Navy’s 250th ceremonies ) which is testament to how hard he leads & works the entire team. I would very much recommend this experience to anyone and will probably find some way to visit again. If you can’t there is always the ship’s YouTube channel which again is top notch. I will remember this visit fondly and so glad I made the journey.",

It was a nice day and very few people were visiting the museum maybe because of the retirement ceremony being held. It was nice to hear over the loud speaker all the high ranking members of the armed forces that boarded the ship while we were touring. Many veterans were on board to  share their experiences and tell stories of their time at sea in the ship. Amazing educational experience. My son said it was the best birthday.",

Bring binoculars to get a close up view. The marsh holds many crabs and fish - all trying to eat/hide from each other. There were no green heads so the hike was very pleasant.

      "content_summary": "Montclair Art Museum is one of New Jersey’s most rewarding art stops: an intimate, thoughtfully curated museum where American art and Native American art share the spotlight. It’s ideal for visitors who want strong collections without big-city crowds—just focused galleries, memorable encounters with painting and sculpture, and a calm, walkable setting in downtown Montclair. Come for the depth in American works, stay for the museum’s distinctive commitment to Indigenous art, and leave feeling like you truly “found yourself here.”",
      "content_description": "**Montclair Art Museum** offers a refreshingly concentrated museum experience—substantial enough to satisfy seasoned art lovers, yet approachable for a half-day visit. Founded in the early 20th century, the museum has long championed American creativity with a curatorial voice that feels both scholarly and welcoming. Its reputation is regional, but its ambitions are larger: the galleries are designed for close looking, with thoughtful interpretation that invites you to trace themes across time—land, identity, modernity, and the evolving idea of “America.”\n\nA defining strength is the museum’s commitment to **American art** alongside a significant presentation of **Native American art**, an approach that encourages visitors to consider parallel histories rather than a single canonical storyline. Expect a mix of painting, works on paper, and sculpture that spans 19th-century traditions through *modernism* and into more contemporary directions, often organized to highlight stylistic shifts—brushwork, abstraction, and the changing role of portraiture and landscape. For travelers who enjoy connecting art to place, this context-rich framing makes the visit feel like a conversation with the region and the nation.\n\nArchitecturally, the museum reads as a classic civic cultural landmark—comfortable in scale, easy to navigate, and well-suited to repeat visits. The visitor experience is deliberately unrushed: galleries that reward slow looking, frequent public programs, and a setting that pairs naturally with a day in Montclair’s cafés and shops. If you’re planning a museum weekend outside Manhattan, **Montclair Art Museum** is a smart, art-forward choice.",

It’s not bad at all, very reasonable experience given that it’s free of charge.\n\nYou get to see a ton of NJ history, paintings, art, old civilization life, artifacts, etc.\n\nThe fossils and animals room definitely was our favorite since we had never seen them up close before in person. There was a very wide array of things to look at and read about in that room in particular. Definitely the highlight of the visit.\n\nThe planetarium costs about $10 per person too so very reasonable. We didn’t end up going but the option is there.\n\nOnly thing I should mention is there were barely any people there on a Saturday afternoon! We saw maybe 5 families throughout the entire building minus the staff.\n\nIt was very very empty compared to other popular places like the Franklin Institute and Art Museum in Philly. Still worth a trip since it’s free experience, but just something to mention since we thought we were in the wrong place the whole time because there was one around.",

We chose the show \"The Great Solar System Adventure\" and it was the perfect balance between whimsy and science. Pre the 'movie', we were given a tour of our very own night sky and the gentleman who provided us this celestial tour (I don't recall his name at the moment, my apologies) was excellent! He was incredibly knowledgeable and you could hear the excitement in his voice. It was obvious he knows our universe very well and enjoys sharing that knowledge. I even spoke with him after the show  and his enthusiasm remained. I asked for book recommendations for someone wanting to begin to understand the cosmos on their own and he gave plenty! I hope he's paid well. The show we saw was at 12pm Saturday September 27th. There weren't too many people there and the overall experience brought our whole family so much joy. We will be returning!",

      "content_description": "In Summit, **Visual Arts Center of New Jersey** offers a museum visit that feels both intimate and forward-looking—an ideal setting for travelers who like their art encounters lively, local, and thoughtfully curated. Rather than a fixed “greatest hits” display, the Center’s strength is its **rotating exhibition program**, bringing together changing perspectives across contemporary art, design, and craft. For visitors, that means the experience is always in motion: you’re likely to encounter new voices, new media, and thematic shows that reward careful looking and repeat visits.\n\nThe building functions as a true arts campus, where **gallery spaces** and **education studios** sit side by side—an architecture of participation rather than distance. That proximity matters: you’re not just observing finished works; you’re stepping into an ecosystem where art is actively made, taught, and discussed. For fans of *contemporary* practice, this creates a satisfying sense of immediacy, as if you’ve entered a community workshop scaled up to museum standards.\n\nPlan to linger: the visitor experience is approachable and conversational, with exhibitions that often foreground process, material experimentation, and what’s happening now in the region’s cultural life. It’s the kind of museum where you can see a show, catch the pulse of local creativity, and leave with ideas—especially fitting for a venue that welcomes you with the invitation to “Find Yourself Here.”",
