I love the creative space that invites visitors to express their own creativity freely during their visit. The suggested donation to enjoy such an enriching experience is only $5 per person. I really appreciate how accessible such an intentional, luxurious experience has been made to the public. I took my 3 little ones (1, 4, and 6 years) with me on a Thursday around 5pm and we had a beautiful time, mostly in the creativity room. I always capture the most beautiful and fascinating pictures, videos, and memories in this space,  which is always the best part of the whole experience for me. The museum does close at 6pm daily and I personally love an evening museum experience... so a later closing on   occasion would really be a plus. Overall I look forward to my next visit... and it will be soon.",

          "text": "A charming little museum in the town where squares can definitely have a ball! The best part of this visit was James A. Erb, Jr. He is a POW survivor with an amazing story which I won't spoil, but get him to tell them to you if you visit. There was also the submarine which is currently no visitable. You still can get a good external view of it though and go out and walk around it. This place has a tribute to every U.S. submarine that has fallen with a detailed story of the ship's adventures and her crew's service for those downed during World War I. The museum itself is manageably sized with a side room featuring some hands=on exhibits. Be aware of the Friday- and Weekend- only hours! I would recommend this museum for any history buffs and military history history buffs especially.",
