  "extract": "Victoria College (VC) is a public community college in Victoria, Texas. The college first began classes in the Patti Welder High School on February 4, 1925. After World War II, because of the growth of the surrounding area and the college population from returning GIs, the college built its own campus and changed its name from the Victoria Junior College to Victoria College. The college shares some facilities with Texas A&M University-Victoria. Victoria College now serves approximately 6,200 students each year through education and training. It is designated by the US Department of Education as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI).",
