The museum’s original building is a restored and repurposed limestone jail built in 1877-1878 by Scottish stonemasons, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The museum has expanded over the decades to include 17,000 square feet of gallery, education, archive, and art storage spaces while offering robust exhibition and education programming. Our standards of excellence in operations and programming have been recognized by the American Alliance of Museums through its accreditation since 1989. \n\nThe museum’s **mission** is to broaden engagement with visual art and culture through exhibitions, education, and preservation. \n\n## [EXHIBITIONS](/exhibitions)\n\nExplore current and upcoming exhibitions.\n\n[ Feb 7 ](/exhibitionlist/2026/willrothfuss)\n\nFeb 7, 2026 – May 16, 2026\n\n[WILL ROTHFUSS: TEXAS CHURCH PROJECT](/exhibitionlist/2026/willrothfuss)\n\nFeb 7, 2026 – May 16, 2026\n\nFeb 7, 2026 – May 16, 2026\n\n[ Feb 7 ](/exhibitionlist/spring2026-danjian)\n\nFeb 7, 2026 – May 16, 2026\n\n[DAN JIAN: PASSING THROUGH](/exhibitionlist/spring2026-danjian)\n\nFeb 7, 2026 – May 16, 2026\n\nFeb 7, 2026 – May 16, 2026\n\n## [EVENTS](/events)\n\nUpcoming events for all ages and interests! \n\n[ Feb 7 ](/eventslist/2026/springo...",
