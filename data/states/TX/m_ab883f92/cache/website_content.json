  "meta_description": "Since 1972, the gleaming white walls of the Art Museum of South Texas have been a landmark on the Corpus Christi Bay. Designed by Philip Johnson, the three-level facility is constructed of poured white concrete and shell aggregate. Expansive windows provide stunning views of the Corpus Christi Bay. An addition completed in October 2006 doubled the Museum’s size, adding new gallery spaces, an expanded Museum Store and a new café that overlooks Corpus Christi Bay and the ship channel.",
