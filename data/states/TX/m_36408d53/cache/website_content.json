Making up [1 billion people worldwide](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability/overview), and [over 56 million domestically](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html), the Disability Community includes members of every marginalized group – every gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, and nation. Anyone can become disabled at any point in their lives. In fact, the longer you live, the greater chance you have of [becoming disabled](https://www.caregiver.org/selected-long-term-care-statistics). On this web page, the word disability is being used as an umbrella term to mean anyone that has a physical, sensory, psychological, chronic health, neurological, cognitive, or social disability. These examples show that disabilities can be both visible and invisible. Ultimately, it is important to understand that there are many different people that have a multitude of different experiences with disabilities. If you have any questions, please email info@heritagesociety.org or call 713-655-1912.\n\nImprovements to accommodate everyone’s needs are always a work in progress.
