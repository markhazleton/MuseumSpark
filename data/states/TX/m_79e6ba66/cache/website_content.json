It was Judd’s goal to bring art, architecture, and land together to form a coherent whole, and for a select group of artists to present work according to their own intentions.\n\nAs an artist-created and artist-centered foundation, Chinati’s mission is to care for its collection and present it to a broad public; to build community and support artists through public programs, artist residencies, educational activities, and exhibitions; and to steward the architecture and the land that Judd conceived as integral to Chinati.\n\n[Guided tours](https://chinati.org/visit-chinati/tours/) are the only way to see the majority of Chinati’s Collection. Currently, Chinati offers three types of guided tours daily: the full collection tour, selections tour, and focus tours. Tours are by reservation only. Complimentary access to Donald Judd’s 15 untitled works in concrete is available Wednesday through Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with last admittance at 4 p.m.\n\nHours and guided tour times are seasonal.
