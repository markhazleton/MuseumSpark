  "extract": "The Umlauf Sculpture Garden & Museum, stylized as the UMLAUF, is a museum and outdoor sculpture garden centered on the artistic works of American sculptor Charles Umlauf. Located at 605 Azie Morton Road in the Zilker neighborhood of Austin, Texas, the garden is adjacent to Austin's Zilker Park. In 1985, Charles and Angeline Umlauf donated their home, studio, and 168 Umlauf sculptures to the City of Austin. Six years later, in 1991, the City built a museum to display the artwork on adjoining city property with private funds. Staff and volunteers maintain the museum with support of grants, donated funds, and contributions from the City of Austin, to maintain the museum and xeriscaped garden. The Museum maintains a seasonal schedule including exhibitions of Charles Umlauf and his twentieth century peers and contemporary art exhibitions.",
