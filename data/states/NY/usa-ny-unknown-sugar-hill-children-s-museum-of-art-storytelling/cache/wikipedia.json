  "extract": "Sugar Hill Children's Museum, officially the Sugar Hill Children's Museum of Art & Storytelling, is a children's museum located in the Sugar Hill neighborhood of Upper Manhattan. The building, which also includes a pre school and affordable housing under the auspices of Broadway Housing Communities, is known as the Sugar Hill Development, and is located at 155th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. The museum was designed by David Adjaye and opened in September 2015. The museum is targeted to children between the ages of three and eight given the impact that arts education has on that age group and focuses on underserved children who might not be reached by traditional art outreach.",
