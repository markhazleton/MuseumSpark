  "extract": "Skidmore College is a private liberal arts college in Saratoga Springs, New York. Approximately 2,700 students are enrolled at Skidmore pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in one of more than 60 areas of study. The college originated from a women's industrial club that was founded by Lucy Skidmore Scribner in 1903 and chartered as a school in 1911. In 1922 it grew into Skidmore College, a baccalaureate-degree-granting institution. In the late 1960s, the college moved from downtown Saratoga Springs to a newly constructed campus on the city's northern border. After a half-century as a women's college, Skidmore became coeducational in 1971.",
