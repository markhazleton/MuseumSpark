Rooted in close observation, the exhibition transforms encounters with nature into invented forms that blur the boundaries between abstraction, figuration, and storytelling. Works are made using a multitude of materials, including plaster, ceramic, foam, oil and acrylic paint, canvas, mylar, ink, fabric and frequently photography that is buried in the work.\n\n[PRESS RELEASE](https://www.woodstockart.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Yura-Adams_Press-Release.pdf)\n\n[__](https://m.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.woodstockart.org/event/yura-adams-marvels-cabinet/ \"Facebook\")[__](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Yura%20Adams%3A%20Marvel%E2%80%99s%20Cabinet%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodstockart.org%2Fevent%2Fyura-adams-marvels-cabinet%2F%20Yura%20Adams%3A%20Marvel%E2%80%99s%20Cabinet%0D%0A%0D%0AEXHIBITION%3A%20January%2023%E2%80%93March%208%2C%202026%0D%0AOPENING%20RE...",
