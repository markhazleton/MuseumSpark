The New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) has awarded **$349,578** to ArtsWestchester. This is funding that will help sustain local creators and cultural organizations through 2026 and 2027. NYSCA — whose mission is to foster and advance arts, culture and creativity throughout New York State — will distribute more than $161 million statewide in FY 2026, reaching organizations and artists across the state.\n\nAs ArtsWestchester CEO **Kathleen Reckling** explains, this latest award underscores the importance of statewide partnerships: “As a statewide community regrant partner with NYSCA, this award ensures that ArtsWestchester can support transformative creative projects in Westchester and Rockland counties in 2026 and 2027.” She adds that in a challenging year for the arts, the support “reaffirms New York State as a leader in fostering a vibrant arts and culture sector.”\n\nState funding also plays a central role in ArtsWestchester’s **Arts Alive** grants, which have long provided a foundation for community-based work. **Erika Mallin** , Executive Director of NYSCA, emphasizes the broader significance of this investment: “We know this support isn’t just an investment in the arts; it’s an investment in New York’s future.”\n\nO...",
