  "extract": "The National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame, in the Saratoga Spa State Park, Saratoga Springs, New York, was established in 1986. It has been indefinitely closed since March 2020 since the pandemic-forced shutdown. The museum contains photographs, videos, artifacts, costumes, and biographies. The museum is located in the former Washington Bath House and was founded by Marylou Whitney. It is related to the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and provided dance classes and master classes through the Lewis A. Swyer School for the Arts, which hosted the New York State Summer School of the Arts during July and August. The National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame purposed a mission from its very foundation. It was \"to cultivate, promote, foster, sponsor, and develop among its members and the community at large, the appreciation, understanding, taste, and love of the Musical Arts, especially the Dance; to create a National Hall of Fame for the advancement of such purposes; to secure the interest of the patrons of these Arts, and to promote and encourage the means for popular instruction and enjoyment thereof.\"",
