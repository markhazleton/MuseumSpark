  "extract": "Guild Hall of East Hampton in the incorporated Village of East Hampton on Long Island's East End, is one of the United States' first multidisciplinary cultural institutions. Opened in 1931, it was designed by architect Aymar Embury II and includes a visual art museum with three galleries and the Hilarie and Mitchell Morgan Theater, a 1931 jewel-box proscenium stage. Following a comprehensive renovation completed in 2024, the facility features upgraded museum galleries, theater space, and educational facilities. It is historically significant for its role in exhibiting the works of the American Abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, John Ferren, and Robert Motherwell; performances by Helen Hayes, Thornton Wilder, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon, Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, and hundreds of other world-class stars of stage and screen; and involvement by the literary figures George Plimpton, Peter Matthiessen, Gore Vidal, Edward Albee, and John Steinbeck. Guild Hall presents more than 200 programs annually and hosts approximately 60,000 visitors each year. It holds a permanent collection of 2,400 works of art and continues to build on important relationships in the worlds of film, theatre, dance, music, and visual art. The museum's current Executive Director is Andrea Grover, who was previously Curator of Special Projects of the Parrish Art Museum.",
