  "accessibility_text": "# Accessibility \n\nDue to the historic nature of the Old Stone Fort Museum Complex, the majority of our buildings are not accessible to wheelchair users. The first floor of the Fort is wheelchair accessible; however, our other buildings and upper floor of the Fort are not. Because of these limitations, visitors with mobility challenges that make it difficult to comfortably explore the full complex will receive complimentary admission for themselves and one support person. Please notify our staff at the desk.\n\nTo help provide access to the exhibits located upstairs in the Fort, we offer a tablet containing photographs of most items on display. Everyone is welcome to use it, simply ask one of our Museum Interpreters for assistance. We are also committed to expanding online access to our collections, and many of our upstairs exhibits are being added to our [**Museum of a Museum**](https://theoldstonefort.org/museum-of-a-museum/) online exhibit.\n\nThere are currently no ADA-accessible restrooms on site. During our open season (May–October), we provide an accessible portable restroom located across the street between the Schoolhouse and Hartmann’s Dorf House. We anxiously await the completion of our new Library and Storage Building, which will provide permanent ADA-accessible restrooms for the site.\n\nWe remain committed to improving accessibility across our site and welcome questions or accommodation requests from visitors.\n\nDue to the historic nature of the Old Stone Fort Museum Co...",
