  "extract": "Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center (aka Hallwalls) is a non-profit art organization located in Buffalo, New York. Since 1974, Hallwalls has shown and shows the work of contemporary artists of diverse backgrounds who work in film, video, literature, music, performance, media and the visual arts. The ideology behind Hallwalls has always been: \"Hallwalls provides direct access to developing ideas in Art for Western New York and Southern Ontario. This is accomplished through exhibitions, a visiting Artist/Critic program, and correspondence with other organizations involved with recent art in the United States, Canada and Europe.\". “Hallwalls came into existence through a convergence of factors. Initiated by the ambitious friendship of (Charles) Clough and (Robert) Longo, fueled by new state funding to alternative spaces, and embraced by a hungry Buffalo arts community, it rapidly picked up speed and girth as it tumbled onto existence.\"",
