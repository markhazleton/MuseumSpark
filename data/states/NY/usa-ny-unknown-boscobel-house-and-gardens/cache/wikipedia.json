  "extract": "Garrison is a hamlet in Putnam County, New York, United States. It is part of the town of Philipstown, on the east side of the Hudson River, across from the United States Military Academy at West Point. The Garrison Metro-North Railroad station serves the town. Garrison, which is also known as Garrison's Landing, was named after 2nd Lieutenant Isaac Garrison, who held a property lot on the Hudson River across from West Point and conducted a ferry service across the Hudson River between the two hamlets. Isaac and his son Beverly Garrison fought in the Battle of Fort Montgomery in 1777, were captured by the British and later set free. The Garrison train wreck took place near Garrison on the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad on October 24, 1897, killing 20 people.",
