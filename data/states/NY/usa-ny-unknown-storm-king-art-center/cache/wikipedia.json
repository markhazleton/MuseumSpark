It contains perhaps the largest collection of contemporary outdoor sculptures in the United States. Founded in 1960 by Ralph E. Ogden as a museum for Hudson River School paintings, it soon became a major sculpture venue with works from some of the most acclaimed artists of the 20th century. The site covers about 500 acres (200 ha; 0.78 sq mi), and is located about a one-hour drive north of Manhattan.",
