In 2020, HMA adopted a suggested admission policy to eradicate cost barriers. Currently, free admission for the community is made possible through a generous grant from Bank of America.

QR codes in the galleries provide multi-language wall text translation to hundreds of languages. Year-round public programming and collaborative efforts connect ongoing organization-wide work to advance diversity, equity, accessibility, accountability, and inclusion throughout the Museum.\n\nSpanish translation and ASL is made possible by the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature.\n\n  * A wheelchair is available upon request for exploring the galleries.\n  * Service animals are permitted in all galleries.\n  * Parking for individuals with disabilities is available in the lot adjacent to the Museum.\n  * There is an accessible restroom for individuals with disabilities in the Museum.\n  * Large print versions of all Museum wall labels are available.
