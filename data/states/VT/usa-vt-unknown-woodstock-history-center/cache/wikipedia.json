  "extract": "Woodstock 1999 (also called Woodstock '99) was a music festival held from July 22 to July 25, 1999, in Rome, New York, United States. After Woodstock '94, it was the second large-scale music festival that attempted to emulate the original 1969 Woodstock festival. Like the previous festivals, it was held in upstate New York; the festival site was the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, roughly 100 miles (160 km) northwest of the 1969 Woodstock site in Bethel. Approximately 220,000 people attended the festival over the 3 days. MTV covered the festival extensively, and live coverage was available on pay-per-view. Westwood One held its radio rights. Excerpts were released on CD and DVD. In Canada, the event was covered by Much; their coverage included interviews with artists and attendees, but not the musical performances. The festival was marred by sexual harassment and rapes, difficult environmental conditions, overpriced food and water, poor sanitation, rioting, looting, vandalism, arson, violence, and three deaths, leading to media attention and controversy that vastly overshadowed coverage of the musical performances. It has been described as \"a flashpoint in cultural nadir\", \"like a concentration camp\", like being \"in another country during military conflict\", and like \"a scene where zombies are coming over the castle walls\", with the morning after likened to the Bosnian War.",
