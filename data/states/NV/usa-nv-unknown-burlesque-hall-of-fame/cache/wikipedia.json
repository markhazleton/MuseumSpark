  "extract": "The Burlesque Hall of Fame (BHOF) was the world's only museum dedicated to the history, preservation, and future of the art of burlesque. Located in the Las Vegas Arts district at 1027 S Main St. #110, BHOF was a tourist destination and non-profit 501 (c)(3) educational organization offering tours of its vast collection of costumes, memorabilia, props and ephemera from burlesque's heyday through contemporary practice; classes for individuals and groups at all levels including beginner; movie screenings; research access for students and journalists; and a gift shop. It closed its door on 20 July 2025. Formerly known as Exotic World, the museum began as the personal collection of striptease artist and founding member of The Exotic Dancers' League of America Jennie Lee. After her death in 1990, her friend and fellow entertainer, Dixie Evans, created the museum in Helendale, California, and launched the \"Miss Exotic World\" Competition in 1990. In 2006, The Burlesque Hall of Fame relocated from Helendale to Las Vegas, NV, to establish itself as a permanent tourist attraction and exhibition space for its collection. After nearly a decade in the Emergency Arts building in the heart of a revitalized Downtown Las Vegas, the museum moved to Las Vegas' Arts district in 2018. This Miss Exotic World competition was in its 29th year (as of 2019), and has grown to become The Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekender, a four-day convention held annually in Las Vegas that includes class, vending, museum tours, pin-up safaris, and four nights of showcases: Movers, Shakers, and Innovators; The Titans of Tease Reunion (then in its 68th year); The Miss Exotic World Competition; and Icons and All-Stars.",
