# MuseumSpark
A Walker Art Reciprocal Program museum ranking and trip-planning application.

MuseumSpark’s core dataset is built from Walker’s reciprocal museum list, extracted into `data/index/walker-reciprocal.csv`, then enriched into full museum records matching the schema/API so members can plan trips, compare museums, and review opportunities enabled by reciprocal membership.
